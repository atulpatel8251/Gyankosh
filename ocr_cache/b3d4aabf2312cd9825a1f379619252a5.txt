In such media the cells tend to take up water
by osmosis. The cell swells, building up
pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts
an equal pressure against the swollen cell.

withstand much greater changes in the

The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell.
Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids
and proteins.
The cell membrane is an active part of the cell. It regulates
the movement of materials between the ordered interior of
the cell and the outer environment.
In plant cells, a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is
located outside the cell membrane.
The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants,
fungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without
bursting.
The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm
by double-layered membrane and it directs the life processes
of the cell.
The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular
transport and as a manufacturing surface.
The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound
vesicles that function in the storage, modification and
packaging of substances manufactured in the cell.
Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called
plastids, which are of two types—chromoplasts and
leucoplasts.

Chromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts
and they perform photosynthesis.
The primary function of leucoplasts is storage.
Most mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that
helps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores
important substances including wastes.
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, their
chromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid, and they
have only very small ribosomes as organelles.
Cells in organisms divide for growth of body, for repalcing
dead cells, and for forming gametes for reproduction.
