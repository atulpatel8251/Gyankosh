 The Age of Social Change

In the previous chapter you read about the powerful ideas of freedom
and equality that circulated in Europe after the French Revolution.
The French Revolution opened up the possibility of creating a
dramatic change in the way in which society was structured. As you
have read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided                                                                                   c

controlled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,                                                                                                  ~
it seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including                                                                                            =

favour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of
England, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals
also opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted
to safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They
argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject
to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent
of rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They
did not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every
citizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the
vote. They also did not want the vote for women.
In contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based
on the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s
suffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges
of great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not
against the existence of private property but disliked concentration
of property in the hands of a few.
Conservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French
Revolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to
the need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives
had been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth
century, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed
that the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about
through a slow process.
Such differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social
and political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The
various attempts at revolution and national transformation in the
nineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of
these political tendencies.

with others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere — including India

.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe
Perhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be
structured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism
was a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.
Socialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills
of the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment
but the propertied were concerned only with personal gain and not with
the welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a
whole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention
would be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and
campaigned for it.
How could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of
socialist society?
Socialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of
cooperatives. Robert Owen (77[-858), a leading English manufacturer,
sought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana
(USA), Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide
scale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments
encourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (8435-882
wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist
enterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who
produced goods together and divided the profits according to the work
done by members.
ks}
E     Karl Marx (88-883) and Friedrich Engels (820-89) added other ideas
2      to this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.
E      Capitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists
£     was produced by workers. The conditions of workers could not improve
8      as long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to
=    overthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that
E     to free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a
2    radically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This    Activity
would be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would
triumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural       List two differences between the capitalist

.4 Support for Socialism
By the |8705, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate
their efforts, socialists formed an international body — namely, the
Second International.                                          Activity
Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to    Imagine that a meeting has been called in

active in the countryside through the late nineteenth century. They
formed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 4900, This party struggled
for peasants’ tights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be
transferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist
Revolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not

2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 905 Revolution
Russia was an autocracy. Unlike other European rulers, even at the
beginning of the twentieth century, the Tsar was not subject to
32                                                2024-25
parliament. Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.
Together with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,
they worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of
905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire
by nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated
areas by jadidists who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.
The year |904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices
of essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per
cent. The membership of workers’ associations rose dramatically.
When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which
had been formed in 4 904, were dismissed at the Putilov lron Works,
there was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over
0,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a
reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages
and improvement in working conditions.
When the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the
Winter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over
00 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,
known as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known
as the |905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and
universities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,
complaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,
engineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of
Unions and demanded a constituent assembly.
During the 4905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an
elected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during
the revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and
factory committees made up of factory workers. After [905, most                                             5

In the winter of 97, conditions in the capital, Petrograd, were grim.
The layout of the city seemed to emphasise the divisions among its
people. The workers’ quarters and factories were located on the right
bank of the River Neva. On the left bank were the fashionable areas,
the Winter Palace, and official buildings, including the palace where
the Duma met. In February 97, food shortages were deeply felt in
the workers’ quarters. The winter was very cold — there had been
exceptional frost and heavy snow. Parliamentarians wishing to
preserve elected government, were opposed to the Tsar’s desire to dissolve
the Duma.
On 22 February, a lockout took place at a
factory on the right bank. The next day, workers
in fifty factories called a strike in sympathy.
In many factories, women led the way to strikes.                a,

striking workers had gathered to form a ‘soviet’ or ‘council’ in the
same building as the Duma met. This was the Petrograd Soviet.
The very next day, a delegation went to see the Tsar. Military
commanders advised him to abdicate. He followed their advice and
abdicated on 2 March. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a
Provisional Government to run the country. Russia’s future would
be decided by a constituent assembly, elected on the basis of universal
adult suffrage. Petrograd had led the February Revolution that
brought down the monarchy in February |907,
Box
Women in the February Revolution
‘Women workers, often ... inspired their male co-workers ... At the Lorenz telephone
factory, ... Marfa Vasileva almost single handedly called a successful strike. Already that
morning, in celebration of Women’s Day, women workers had presented red bows to the
men ... Then Marfa Vasileva, a milling machine operator stopped work and declared an
impromptu strike. The workers on the floor were ready to support her ... The foreman
informed the management and sent her a loaf of bread. She took the bread but refused to
go back to work. The administrator asked her again why she refused to work and she
replied, “| cannot be the only one who is satiated when others are hungry”. Women
workers from another section of the factory gathered around Marfa in support and
gradually all the other women ceased working. Soon the men downed their tools as well
and the entire crowd rushed onto the street.’

Army officials, landowners and industrialists were influential in
the Provisional Government. But the liberals as well as socialists
among them worked towards an elected government. Restrictions

The October Revolution and the Russian Countryside: Two Views
‘News of the revolutionary uprising of October 25, 97, reached the village the following day and
was greeted with enthusiasm; to the peasants it meant free land and an end to the war. ... The day
the news arrived, the landowner’s manor house was looted, his stock farms were “requisitioned”
and his vast orchard was cut down and sold to the peasants for wood; all his far buildings were
torn down and left in ruins while the land was distributed among the peasants who were prepared
to live the new Soviet life’.
From: Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm
A member of a landowning family wrote to a relative about what happened at the estate:
‘The “coup” happened quite painlessly, quietly and peacefully. ... The first days were unbearable..
Mikhail Mikhailovich [the estate owner] was calm...The girls also... must say the chairman
behaves correctly and even politely. We were left two cows and two horses. The servants tell them
all the time not to bother us. “Let them live. We vouch for their safety and property. We want them
treated as humanely as possible....”
... There are rumours that several villages are trying to evictthe committees and return the estate
to Mikhail Mikhailovich. | don’t know if this will happen, orf it’s good for us. But we rejoice that
there is a conscience in our people...’

M.N.Roy was an Indian revolutionary, a founder of the Mexican Communist Party
and prominent Comintern leader in India, China and Europe. He was in Central
Asia at the time of the civil war in the 920s. He wrote:
‘The chieftain was a benevolent old man; his attendant ... a youth who ... spoke
Russian ... He had heard of the Revolution, which had overthrown the Tsar and
driven away the Generals who conquered the homeland of the Kirgiz. So, the
Revolution meant that the Kirgiz were masters of their home again. “Long Live the                             लि

4.2 Making a Socialist Society
During the civil war, the Bolsheviks kept industries and banks
nationalised. They permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had
been socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what
collective work could be.
A process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed
how the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.
On this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed
all prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ‘Plans’

Socialist Cultivation in a Village in the Ukraine
‘A commune was set up using two [confiscated] farms as a base. The commune
consisted of thirteen families with a total of seventy persons ... The farm tools taken
from the ... farms were turned over to the commune ... The members ate in a communal
dining hall and income was divided in accordance with the principles of “cooperative
communism”. The entire proceeds of the members’ labor, as well as all dwellings and
facilities belonging to the commune were shared by the commune members.”

What followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 4929,
the Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (ko/khoz).
The bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership
of collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the ko/khox
profit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and
destroyed their livestock. Between 4929 and |93, the number of
cattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were
severely punished. Many were deported and exiled. As they resisted

Official view of the opposition to collectivisation and the government response
‘From the second half of February of this year, in various regions of the Ukraine
... Mass insurrections of the peasantry have taken place, caused by distortions
of the Party’s line by a section of the lower ranks of the Party and the Soviet
apparatus in the course of the introduction of collectivisation and preparatory
work for the spring harvest.
Within a short time, large scale activities from the above-mentioned regions
carried over into neighbouring areas - and the most aggressive insurrections
have taken place near the border.
The greater part of the peasant insurrections have been linked with outright
demands for the return of collectivised stocks of grain, livestock and tools ...
Between ist February and i5th March, 25,000 have been arrested ... 656 have
been executed, 3673 have been imprisoned in labour camps and 5580 exiled ...
Report of K.M. Karlson, President of the State Police Administration of the Ukraine
to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, on 49 March 4930,
From: V. Sokolov (ed), Obshchestvo I Vlast, v 2930-./6 gody

Many within the Party criticised the confusion in industrial

production under the Planned Economy and the consequences of

collectivisation. Stalin and his sympathisers charged these critics with

conspiracy against socialism. Accusations were made throughout the

country, and by 4939, over 2 million were in prisons or labour camps.

Most were innocent of the crimes, but no one spoke for them. A

large number were forced to make false confessions under torture

and were executed — several among them were talented professionals.

The Global Influence of the Russian
Revolution and the USSR
Existing socialist parties in Europe did not wholly approve of the
way the Bolsheviks took power — and kept it. However, the possibility
of a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In
many countries, communist parties were formed — like the
Communist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged
colonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from
outside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of
the East (]9200 and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international
union of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in
the USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By
the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had
given socialism a global face and world stature.
Yet by the 9505 it was acknowledged within the country that the
style of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals
of the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it
was recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward
country had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture
had developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the
essential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental
projects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth
century, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist
country had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals
still enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas                       esos ame      -
of socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.                              INDO-     \-  an  i

An Indian arrives in Soviet Russia in अ920

‘For the first time in our lives, we were seeing Europeans

mixing freely with Asians. On seeing the Russians mingling

freely with the rest of the people of the country we were

convinced that we had come to a land of real equality.

We saw freedom in its true light. In spite of their poverty,

imposed by the counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists,

the people were more jovial and satisfied than ever before.

The revolution had instilled confidence and fearlessness in

them. The real brotherhood of mankind would be seen here

among these people of fifty different nationalities. No

barriers of caste or religion hindered them from mixing freely

with one another. Every soul was transformed into an orator.

One could see a worker, a peasant or a soldier haranguing

like a professional lecturer.’

Shaukat Usmani, Historic Trips of a Revolutionary.
