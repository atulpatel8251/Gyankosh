Farming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have
been many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed
the farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an
important achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production
a great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.
The new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium
and large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange
for capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who
constitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain                  ;
capital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.
The lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own
savings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have
to do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.
Labour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if
new ways of farming used much more labour. Unfortunately, such a thing has
not happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour, looking for
opportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some
labour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.
At present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every
00 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.
Though there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only
seen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.
In the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the
village. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some
amount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?
One can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is
important that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without
savings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for
expansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services                         v6
produced can be sold. In Palampur, we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and                   fn  ~
cities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get             तर    4
connected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is                 हू       f
possible that the opportunities for non-farm activities in the village would increase                 “n     &
in the coming years.                                                                                                       |)
