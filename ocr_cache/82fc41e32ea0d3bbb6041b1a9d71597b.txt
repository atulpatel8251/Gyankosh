In the spring of [945, a little eleven-year-old German boy called
Helmuth was lying in bed when he overheard his parents discussing
something in serious tones. His father, a prominent physician,
deliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire
family, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about
his fear of revenge, saying, ‘Now the Allies will do to us what we did to
the crippled and Jews.’ The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,
where they spent their last happy time together, singing old children’s
songs. Later, Helmuth’s father shot himself in his office. Helmuth
remembers that he saw his father’s bloody uniform being burnt in the
family fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and
what had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the
following nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.        yy

an unprecedented means of killing people, that is, by gassing them in

sentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were

Birth of the Weimar Republic
Germany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth
century, fought the First World War (94-98) alongside the
Austrian empire and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)
All joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick
victory. Little did they realise that the war would stretch on,
eventually draining Europe of all its resources. Germany made initial
gains by occupying France and Belgium. However the Allies,
strengthened by the US entry in 49]7, won, defeating Germany and the
Central Powers in November 498,
The defeat of Imperial Germany and the abdication of the emperor
gave an opportunity to parliamentary parties to recast German polity.
A National Assembly met at Weimar and established a democratic
constitution with a federal structure. Deputies were now elected to
the German Parliament or Reichstag, on the basis of equal and
universal votes cast by all adults including women.
This republic, however, was not received well by its own people
largely because of the terms it was forced to accept after Germany’s
defeat at the end of the First World War. The peace treaty at

Versailles with the Allies was a harsh and humiliating peace. Germany lost
its overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, |3 per cent of its territories,
75 per cent of its iron and 26 per cent of its coal to France, Poland,
Denmark and Lithuania. The Allied Powers demilitarised Germany to
weaken its power. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for
the war and damages the Allied countries suffered. Germany was forced
to pay compensation amounting to £6 billion. The Allied armies also
occupied the resource-rich Rhineland for much of the |9205. Many
Germans held the new Weimar Republic responsible for not only the
defeat in the war but the disgrace at Versailles.
. The Effects of the War ltt
The war had a devastating impact on the entire continent both
psychologically and financially. From a continent of creditors,
Europe turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar
Republic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The
republic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation
and was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.
Those who supported the Weimar Republic, mainly Socialists, Catholics
and Democrats, became easy targets of attack in the conservative
nationalist circles. They were mockingly called the ‘November criminals’.
This mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the
early 930s, as we will soon see.
The First World War left a deep imprint on European society and
polity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and
publicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong
and masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,
was that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with

z       rats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,

=     and witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda

e     and national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while

हे.     popular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently

नि    come into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,

Ss    which could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.

The years between [924 and 4928 saw some stability. Yet this was
built on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were
totally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This
support was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in
929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their
shares. On one single day, 24 October, 3 million shares were sold.
This was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next
three years, between 929 and 4932, the national income of the USA
fell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit
and speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects
of this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.
The German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By
932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the [929
level. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number
of unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets
of Germany you could see men with placards around their necks
saying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Unemployed youths played cards         ~                     "

businesses got ruined. These sections of society were filled with the
fear of proletarianisation, an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks
of the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised
workers could manage to keep their heads above water, but
unemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was
in crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in
agricultural prices and women, unable to fill their children’s
stomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.
Politically too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar
constitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable
and vulnerable to dictatorship. One was proportional
representation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a
near impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect
was Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose
emergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short
life, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on
an average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis
could not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic
parliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.

 Hitler's Rise to Power
This crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background
to Hitler’s rise to power. Born in [889 in Austria, Hitler spent his
youth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled
for the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and
earned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the
Versailles Treaty made him furious. In 99, he joined a small group
called the German Workers’ Party. He subsequently took over the
organisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’
Party. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.
In 923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin
and capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and
later released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular
support till the early 49305. It was during the Great Depression that
Nazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 4929, banks
collapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the
middle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation
Nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 4928, the Nazi
Party got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag — the
German parliament. By 932, it had become the largest party with
37 per cent votes.

Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved
people. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of
the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.
He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure
future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences
and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.
Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance
of rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies

Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after
the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.
Nazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as
someone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is
an image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of
dignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time
of acute economic and political crises.
2. The Destruction of Democracy बा
On 30 January |933, President Hindenburg offered the
Chancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to
Hitler. By now the Nazis had managed to rally the conservatives to
their cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the
structures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in
the German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.
The Fire Decree of 28 February |933 indefinitely suspended civic
rights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been
guaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his arch-
enemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off
to the newly established concentration camps. The repression of
the Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files
of Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, ],4वीी were
those of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among
the 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.
On 3 March 4933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act
established dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to
sideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade
unions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The
state established complete control over the economy, media, army
and judiciary.

3    Special surveillance and security forces were created to control and
2 order society in ways that the Nazis wanted. Apart from the already
5   existing regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm

&    protection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It

economic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through
expansion of territory. In September 939, Germany invaded
Poland. This started a war with France and England. In September
940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and
Japan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to international power. Puppet
regimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large
part of Europe. By the end of 940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of
his power.
Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering
Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space
for Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June [94. In this
historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British
aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.
The Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat
on Germany at Stalingrad. After this the Soviet Red Army
hounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the
heart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern
Europe for half a century thereafter.
Meanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was
unwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the
First World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war
for long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied
French Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in
the Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed
the US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World                               हर

Jews were not the only community classified as ‘undesirable’. There   लिन escorting gypsies wine are

were others. Many Gypsies and blacks living in Nazi Germany were

considered as racial ‘inferiors’ who threatened the biological purity

of the ‘superior Aryan’ race. They were widely persecuted. Even

Russians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving

of any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of

Russia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many

of them died simply through hard work and starvation.

Jews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred of

Jews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards

Jews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and

usurers.Until medieval times Jews were barred from owning land.

They survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived

in separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted

through periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.

However, Hitler’s hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific

theories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to

‘the Jewish problem’. It could be solved only through their

total elimination.

Stage 2: Ghettoisation 940 - 944
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LIVE AMONG US
From September 94}, all Jews had to wear a yellow Star of David on their breasts. This identity mark was stamped on their passport,
all legal documents and houses. They were kept in Jewish houses in Germany, and in ghettos like Lodz and Warsaw in the east. These
became sites of extreme misery and poverty. Jews had to surrender all their wealth before they entered a ghetto. Soon the ghettos
were brimming with hunger, starvation and disease due to deprivation and poor hygiene.

themselves from Jews, look after the home, and teach their

children Nazi values. They had to be the bearers of the Aryan

culture and race.

In 4933 Hitler said: ‘In my state the mother is the most important

citizen.’ But in Nazi Germany all mothers were not treated equally.

Women who bore racially undesirable children were punished

and those who produced racially desirable children were awarded.

They were given favoured treatment in hospitals and were also

entitled to concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway

fares. To encourage women to produce many children, Honour

Crosses were awarded. A bronze cross was given for four children,

silver for six and gold for eight or more.

All ‘Aryan’ women who deviated from the prescribed code of

conduct were publicly condemned, and severely punished. Those

who maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were

paraded through the town with shaved heads, blackened faces and

placards hanging around their necks announcing ‘I have sullied

the honour of the nation’. Many received jail sentences and lost

civic honour as well as their husbands and families for this

‘criminal offence’.

4.2. The Art Of Propagada mn

The Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to

great effect. The terms they coined to describe their various

practices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never

used the words ‘kill’ or ‘murder’ in their official communications.

Mass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews),

euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. ‘Evacuation’
=    meant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the S@yrce E
5    gas chambers were called? They were labelled ‘disinfection-areas’,
2   and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.      In an address to women at the

Ordinary People and the Crimes Against Humanity
How did the common people react to Nazism?
Many saw the world through Nazi eyes, and spoke their mind in
Nazi language. They felt hatred and anger surge inside them when
they saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses
of Jews and reported suspicious neighbours. They genuinely believed
Nazism would bring prosperity and improve general well-being.
But not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active resistance
to Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority
of Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.
They were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to
look away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an
absence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans
in the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people
in the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:
First they came for the Communists,
Well, | was not a Communist —

Mahatma Gandhi writes to Hitler
LETTER TOADOLF HITLER
AS AT WARDHA, C. P., INDIA,
July 23, 939
HERR HITLER
BERLIN
GERMANY
DEAR FRIEND,
Friends have been urging me to write to you for the sake of
humanity. But | have resisted their request, because of the feeling that
any letter from me would be an impertinence. Something tells me that
| must not calculate and that | must make my appeal for whatever it
may be worth.
It is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world
who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to the savage
state.
Must you pay that price for an object however worthy it may appear
to you to be? Will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately
shunned the method of war not without considerable success?
Anyway
| anticipate your forgiveness, if | have erred in writing to you.
| remain,
Your sincere friend,
M. K. GANDHI                                          —_ a_ 3. था

LETTER TOADOLF HITLER
WARDHA,
December 24, 7940          We have found in non-violence a force which, if organised, can without
doubt match itself against a combination of all the most violent forces in
the world. In non-violent technique, as | have said, there is no such thing                           .
as defeat. It is all ‘do or die’ without killing or hurting. It can be used                             <
practically without money and obviously without the aid of science of                                 =
destruction which you have brought to such perfection. It is a marvel to                             s
me that you do not see that it is nobody’s monopoly. If not the British,                        जि
some other power will certainly improve upon your method and beat you                           fe
with your own weapon. You are leaving no legacy to your people of                                      a
which they would feel proud. They cannot take pride in a recital of cruel                             Es}
deed, however skilfully planned. |, therefore, appeal to you in the name                             7
of humanity to stop the war...                                                                                           5
