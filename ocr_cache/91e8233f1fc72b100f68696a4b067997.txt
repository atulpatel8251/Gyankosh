shows that an average woman works every day for a little over
seven and half hours while an average man works for six and a
half hours. Yet the work done by men is more visible because
most of their work leads to generation of income. Women also do
a lot of direct income generating work, but the bulk of their work
is household related. This work remains unpaid and invisible.

Social and Religious Diversity of India
The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years.
The person who fills the Census form visits every household and records the religion of
each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it. If someone
says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded.
Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities
in the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents
the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since
Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but
their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms,
the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 96.
The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is
a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s
population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for
the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee)
show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4
per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance
of different religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.
The same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social
groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups
include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an official Schedule.
Hence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known
as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social
order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often
referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills
and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 20ii, the Scheduled
Castes were 6.6 per cent and the

Caste inequality today

Caste is an important source of economic inequality because it regulates

access to resources of various kinds. For example, in the past, the so-called
‘untouchable’ castes were denied the right to own land, while only the so-called
‘twice born’ castes had the right to education. Although this kind of explicit and
formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the effects of centuries of
accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt. Moreover, new
kinds of inequalities have also developed.

The relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a
lot. Today, it is possible to find very rich and very poor people in every caste,
whether ‘low’ or ‘high’. This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago - it
was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However,

as this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be
very strongly linked to economic status in many important ways:

The average economic status (measured by criteria like monthly
consumption expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy न
the ‘upper’ castes are best off, the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off, and the
backward classes are in between.

Although every caste has some poor members, the proportion living in
extreme poverty (below the official ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest
castes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once
again in between.

Although every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are
heavily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely
under-represented.
