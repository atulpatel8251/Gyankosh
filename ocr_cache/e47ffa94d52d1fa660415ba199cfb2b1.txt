(a) acceleration is in the direction of
motion,
(b) acceleration is against the
direction of motion,
(c) acceleration is uniform,
(d) acceleration is non-uniform.
o Can you identify one example each
for the above type of motion?

Motion is a change of position; it can be described in terms
of the distance moved or the displacement.
The motion of an object could be uniform or non-uniform
depending on whether its velocity is constant or changing.
The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time,
and velocity is the displacement per unit time.
The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per
unit time.
°    Uniform and non-uniform motions of objects can be shown
through graphs.
The motion of an object moving at uniform acceleration can
be described with the help of the following equations, namely

If an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed,

its motion is called uniform circular motion.
