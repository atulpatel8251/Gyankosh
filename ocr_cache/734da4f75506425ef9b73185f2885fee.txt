8.3 Inertia and Mass
All the examples and activities given so far
illustrate that there is a resistance offered by
an object to change its state of motion. If it is
at rest it tends to remain at rest; ifit is moving
it tends to keep moving. This property of an
object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have
the same inertia? We know that it is easier to
push an empty box than a box full of books.

First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of
rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted
upon by an unbalanced force.
°   The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their
state of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.
The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its SI unit
is kilogram (kg).
Force of friction always opposes motion of objects.
Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of
an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in
the direction of the force.

The SI unit of force is kg m 5. This is also known as newton
and represented by the symbol N. A force of one newton
produces an acceleration of ] m s? on an object of
mass | kg.
The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and
velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity.
Its SI unit is kg m s'.
Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.

the force exerted on the object.

l6. Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that
was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an
insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen.
Akhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation. Kiran
suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in
momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the
motorcar (because the change in the velocity of the insect
was much more than that of the motorcar). Akhtar said
that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity,
it exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the
insect died. Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation

said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the
same force and a change in their momentum. Comment on
these suggestions.

(a) What conclusion can you draw about the acceleration?
Is it constant, increasing, decreasing, or zero?
(b) What do you infer about the forces acting on the object?

A2. Two persons manage to push a motorcar of mass 200 kg at
a uniform velocity along a level road. The same motorcar
can be pushed by three persons to produce an acceleration
of 0.2 m s?. With what force does each person push the
motorcar? (Assume that all persons push the motorcar with
the same muscular effort.)
