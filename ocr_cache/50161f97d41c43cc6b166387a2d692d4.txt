various types of numbers on it (see Fig. [. ).

Just imagine you start from zero and go on walking along this number line in the
positive direction. As far as your eyes can see, there are numbers, numbers and

Now suppose you start walking along the number line, and collecting some of the
numbers. Get a bag ready to store them!

collection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by 0.
‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.
You may recall the definition of rational numbers:
A number ‘7’ is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form श्र 5
where p and q are integers and g # 0. (Why do we insist that g # 0?)
Notice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form 7 , where p
:                      F                              .        ~25
and q are integers and q ¥ 0. For example, —25 can be written as TT> here p =-25
and qg = |. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole
numbers and integers.
You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in
the f     P wh         d       int         dq#0.F          \   l 2 [0 25
e form = , where p and g are integers and g # 0. For example, = = — = ~~ =>
q         paned         8        q                श# 4 20-50
47                               .           .
= 04° and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However,
when we say that . isa rational number, or when we represent दी. on the number
q                                                   q
line, we assume that g # 0 and that p and g have no common factors other than |
(that is, p and g are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many
l                     l
fractions equivalent to > we will choose > to represent all of them.
Now, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you
have studied in earlier classes.
Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.
(i) Every whole number is a natural number.
(ii) Every integer is a rational number.
(ii) Every rational number is an integer.
(i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number.
m
(ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form I and so it is a
rational number.

(iii) False, because 5 is not an integer.
Find five rational numbers between | and 2.
We can approach this problem in at least two ways.
Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add 7 and
नि                         . rts.                            3.
s and divide the sum by 2, that is > lies between r and s. So, 3 is a number
between | and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers
rT                          5 Il 3      7
between | and 2. These four numbers are —> —» — and —-
4 8 8      4
The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since
we want five numbers, we write | and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + |,
ie., |  6  d2  2 Th        heck th  ms OA  idi    Il rational
i.e., | न > and2=—. Then youcan check that —, >, >, — and — are all rationa’

numbers between | and 2. So, the five numbers are —> >> =» — and — ,
63 2 3      6
Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers
between | and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many
rational numbers between | and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational
numbers between any two given rational numbers.

Let us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?
Not, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number
line! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just
one or two but infinitely many. The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many
numbers lying between any two of these gaps too!

We saw, in the previous section, that there may be numbers on the number line that
are not rationals. In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far, all
the numbers you have come across, are of the form , where p and q are integers
and q #0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are
indeed such numbers.
The Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous
mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first               €
to discover the numbers which were not rationals, around           का
400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers         न अर
(irrationals), because they cannot be written in the form of            cn 7
a ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the             a
discovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean,               ’
Hippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an               के
७
unfortunate end, either for discovering that V2 is irrational                              ले
or for disclosing the secret about V2 to people outside the           Pythagoras    E
secret Pythagorean sect!                                                         (569 BCE — 479 BCE)
Let us formally define these numbers.
A number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form 2 , where p
q
and q are integers and g #0.
2024-25
You already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there
are infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are:
V2, V3, दीड ७ 0.00II900...

Recall that when we use the symbol / , we assume that it is the
positive square root of the number. So ./4 = 2, though both 2 and —2 are square
roots of 4.

Some of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you
have already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number 7.
The Pythagoreans proved that ./9 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC,
Theodorus of Cyrene showed that J3, J5, V6, V7, बीए, Vil, री2, ची3, चीव, VIS
and ,/{7 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of /2 , /3. डी, etc., shall be
discussed in Class X. As to 7, it was known to various cultures for thousands of
years, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late !700s.
In the next section, we will discuss why 0.0[0]0][[0... and z are irrational.
Let us return to the questions raised at the end of
the previous section. Remember the bag of rational           ce SRT
numbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into      fe oP
the bag, will there be any number left on the number        ie कह ८ F               a
line? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection        \ oro १9      ™~»

make up what we call the collection of real numbers,                4                डी
which is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we
can say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number
line. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number.
This is why we call the number line, the real number line.
In the |8705 two German mathematicians,
Cantor and Dedekind, showed that :

Let us see how we can locate some of the irrational numbers on the number line.
Locate 2 on the number line.
It is easy to see how the Greeks might have discovered
V2 . Consider a square OABC, with each side | unit in length (see
Fig. .6). Then you can see by the Pythagoras theorem that
OB= VP +PP + 2 = J2.How do we represent 2 on the number line?
This is easy. Transfer Fig. 4.6 onto the number line making sure that the vertex 0
coincides with zero (see Fig. .7).
We have just seen that OB = ,/2 . Using a compass with centre 0 and radius OB,
draw an arc intersecting the number line at the point P. Then P corresponds to ./7 on
the number line.
Locate /3 on the number line.
Let us return to Fig. [.7.
Construct BD of unit length perpendicular to OB (as in Fig. .8). Then using the
Pythagoras theorem, we see that OD = (vay +P (v2) +P =¥3. Using a compass, with
centre O and radius OD, draw an are which intersects the number line at the point Q.
Then Q corresponds to V3 .
2024-25
In the same way, you can locate ./n for any positive integer n, after ना7 - | has been
located.
l. State whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answers.
(i) Every irrational number is a real number.
(i) Every point on the number line is of the form vm , where m is a natural number.
(iti) Every real number is an irrational number.
2. Are the square roots of all positive integers irrational? If not, give an example of the
square root of a number that is a rational number.
3. Show how V5 can be represented on the number line.
4. Classroom activity (Constructing the ‘square root
spiral’) : Take a large sheet of paper and construct
the ‘square root spiral’ in the following fashion. Start
with a point O and draw a line segment OP, of unit
length. Draw a line segment P,P, perpendicular to
OP, of unit length (see Fig. .9). Now draw a line
segment P,P, perpendicular to OP,. Then draw a line
segment P,P, perpendicular to OP,. Continuing in
this manner, you can get the line segment P,P, by
drawing a line segment of unit length perpendicular to OP, ,. In this manner, you will
have created the points P,, P,,...., P,,... ., and joined them to create a beautiful spiral
depicting /2, J3, V/4,...
In this section, we are going to study rational and irrational numbers from a different
point of view. We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we
can use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also
explain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using
their decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with
0 7 |
them. Let us take three examples : 737°
Pay special attention to the remainders and see if you can find any pattern.

Divisor : 7
What have you noticed? You should have noticed at least three things:
(i) The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves.
(ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor
0                                          ]
(in z one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 7 there are six entries
32645] in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor).
(ii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient
[0                             l
(for 3: 3 repeats in the quotient and for 7 we get the repeating block 42857
in the quotient).
2024-25
Although we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all
rationals of the form 2. (q #0). On division of p by 4, two main things happen — either
q
the remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of
remainders. Let us look at each case separately.
The remainder becomes zero
7                              कि
In the example of 3° we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and
कि              .       7                                     ||          639
the decimal expansion of 8 = 0.875. Other examples are 3 =0.5, 250 = 2.556. Inall
these cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps.
We call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating.
The remainder never becomes zero
0        l           .                    दे                               .
In the examples of 3 and 7 we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain
stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a
repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating
ng. F                0                     |
recurring. For example, 373.3333... and 7 = 0.428574285742857...
The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 3 is to write it as 3.3.
Similarly, since the block of digits |42857 repeats in the quotient of 7 we write 7 as
0.42857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats.
Also 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating
recurring (repeating) decimal expansions.
Thus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices:
either they are terminating or non-terminating recurring.
Now suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a
number like 3.l42678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like
.272727... that is, |.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can
you conclude that it is a rational number? The answer is yes!
2024-25
We will not prove it but illustrate this fact with a few examples. The terminating cases
are easy.
Show that 3. [42678 is a rational number. In other words, express 3.!42678
in the form 77 , where p and q are integers and g # 0.
342678
We have 3. 42678 = ——— ; and hence is a rational number.
000000
Now, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring.
Show that 0.3333... = 0.3 canbe expressed in the form z , where p and
q are integers and q # 0.
Since we do not know what 03 is , let us call it ‘x’ and so
x = 0.3333...
Now here is where the trick comes in. Look at
[0 जक्ष 0 x (0.333...) = 3.333...
Now,                              3.3333...= 3 +x, since x = 0.3333...
Therefore,                                 l0x=3+x
Solving for x, we get
Ox = 3, i      -!
w= 3,28, = 5
Show that .272727... = .27 can be expressed in the form थी , where p
and q are integers and q # 0.
Let x = .272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by l00 to
get
00 x = 27.2727...
So,                                      |00 x = 26 + [.272727... = थ26 न जा
Therefore,                      [00 x —x = 426, ie., 99. न 26

Let x = 0.235. Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35
repeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 00 to get
00 x = 23.53535...
So,                                      00 x = 23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 +x
Therefore,                                 99 x= 23.3

You can also check the reverse that 900 > 0.235.
So, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed
in the form 2 (q 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the
q
following form :
The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-
terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is
terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational.
So, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What
about the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above,
we can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring.
So, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational
numbers, is
The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring.
Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring
is irrational.

Recall s = 0.000][0... from the previous section. Notice that it is non-

Moreover, notice that you can generate infinitely many irrationals similar to s.

to a certain stage.

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more
and more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you
might have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of ./2 by the division method.
Interestingly, in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic
period (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of ./2 as follows:

Notice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The
history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of 7 is very interesting.

You have learnt, in earlier classes, that rational numbers satisfy the commutative,
associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. Moreover, if we add,
subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational
number (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the
commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However,
the sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always
irrational. F     le, (J6) + (v6) (v2) - (V2), (W3)-(V3) and ap
irrational. For example, (  6) + (- 6) ;(  2) = (  2), (  3+  3) an   Jy  are
rationals.

Let us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an
irrational number. For example, V3 is irrational. What about 2 + 3 and 23 ? Since
V3 has a non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for
2+ 3 and wW3 . Therefore, both 2 + V3 and 23 are also irrational numbers.

.G   7                       :    :

All these are non-terminating non-recurring decimals. So, all these are irrational numbers.
Now, let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply, divide, take
square roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where n is any natural
number. Let us look at some examples.
Add 2V2 +53 and J2 —3V3.
(2V2 +53) +(V/2 33) = (2V2 + V2) + (5V3 - 33)
= (2क 2 + (5 —3)v3 =3V2 + 2V3

Divide 8yI5 by 2V3.

These examples may lead you to expect the following facts, which are true:
(i) The sum or difference ofa rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
(ii) The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is
irrational.
(iii) If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or
irrational.

We now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers.
Recall that, if a is a natural number, then Ja =h means b?=a and b > 0. The same
definition can be extended for positive real numbers.

Let a > 0 be a real number. Then ./q = 5 means b? =a and b > 0.
In Section |.2, we saw how to represent Vn for any positive integer n on the number
line. We now show how to find ./x for any given positive real number x geometrically.
For example, let us find it for x = 3.5, ie., we find 3,5 geometrically.
Mark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such
that AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. I.ll). From B, mark a distance of | unit and mark the
new point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle
with centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and
intersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = 355.

2024-25
More generally, to find Vx , for any positive real
number x, we mark B so that AB = x units, and, as in
Fig. [.2, mark C so that BC = | unit. Then, as we
have done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = vx
(see Fig. |.!2). We can prove this result using the
Pythagoras Theorem.
Notice that, in Fig. .2, AOBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle
 x4.
is   units.
x+l.
Therefore, OC = OD = OA = a units.
x    कक न
Now, OB =         5)         2
So, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have
BD? = OD? - OB = = a व - G2 xJ -_y
Cee          2        4 7°
This shows that BD = Jy .
This construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that \/y exists for
all real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of ./ on the number line,
then let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as |, and so on.
Draw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E
(see Fig. .3). Then, E represents Vx.
2024-25
We would like to now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots,
and in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer. Recall your understanding of
square roots and cube roots from earlier classes.

What is 3/g ? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and
you must have guessed ag = 2. Let us try 3243 . Do you know some number 4 such
that b> = 243? The answer is 3. Therefore, 3/243 = 3.

From these examples, can you define “/g fora real number a > 0 and a positive
integer n?

Let a > 0 be a real number and n be a positive integer. Then शुद्धि = b, if b" =a and
b> 0. Note that the symbol‘ / ’ used in J2, 3/8, 4/a , etc. is called the radical sign.

We now list some identities relating to square roots, which are useful in various
ways. You are already familiar with some of these from your earlier classes. The
remaining ones follow from the distributive law of multiplication over addition of real
numbers, and from the identity (x + y) (x — y) =x? —y’, for any real numbers x and y.
Let a and b be positive real numbers. Then

(० (va + vb) (Je +d) = Jae + Jad + Joe + Jbd
(vi) (va + vb) =a + 2Vab +b
Let us look at some particular cases of these identities.
Simplify the following expressions:
(i)  (5 + v7) (2 + V5)                     (ii) (5 + N5) (5 - V5)
(ii) (V3 + V7)                            tiv) (Vil = V7) (Vi + v7)

(iv) (Vil - V7) (Vil +7) =(vil) -(V7) =I-7=4

Note that ‘simplify’ in the example above has been used to mean that the
expression should be written as the sum of a rational and an irrational number.

We end this section by considering the following problem. Look at Wey" Can you tell
where it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier
to handle if the denominator is a rational number. Let us see, if we can ‘rationalise’ the
denominator, that is, to make the denominator into a rational number. To do so, we
need the identities involving square roots. Let us see how.
Rationalise the denominator of 2

We want to write Wed as an equivalent expression in which the denominator

is a rational number. We know that ,/2 . /2 is rational. We also know that multiplying
त b ve  ill gi        ival        i   i   2  L.S       h

Ya ’Y a will give us an equivalent expression, since a     0, we put these two
facts together to get

So, when the denominator of an expression contains a term with a square root (or
a number under a radical sign), the process of converting it to an equivalent expression
whose denominator is a rational number is called rationalising the denominator.

To get these answers, you would have used the following laws of exponents,
which you have learnt in your earlier classes. (Here a, 7 and m are natural numbers.
Remember, a is called the base and m and n are the exponents.)

2024-25
What is (a)°? Yes, it is !! So you have learnt that (a)° = I. So, using (iii), we can
get ye =a“. We can now extend the laws to negative exponents too.
So, for example :

(iii)  37 = 23-7              (iv) (7)? - (9)?° = (63
Suppose we want to do the following computations:
2    I                                  I  4

How would we go about it? It turns out that we can extend the laws of exponents
that we have studied earlier, even when the base is a positive real number and the
exponents are rational numbers. (Later you will study that it can further to be extended
when the exponents are real numbers.) But before we state these laws, and to even
3
make sense of these laws, we need to first understand what, for example 42 is. So,
we have some work to do!
We define #/q for a real number a > 0 as follows:
Let a > 0 be a real number and 7 a positive integer. Then ala = b, if b" =a and
b>0.
i                              |
In the language of exponents, we define da = a". So, in particular, 3/2 = 23.

There are now two ways to look at 42.
Bf iy.
42 = [4] =2=8
3         L        l
4 = (4)? =(64)2 =8
2024-25
Therefore, we have the following definition:
Let a > 0 be a real number. Let m and # be integers such that m and # have no
common factors other than l, and n > 0. Then,
We now have the following extended laws of exponents:
Let a > 0 be a real number and p and q be rational numbers. Then, we have
(i) a. दर न द्रव                   (ii) (दर? = ars

(ii) a =a?‘                    (iv) a’b? = (aby
You can now use these laws to answer the questions asked earlier.
