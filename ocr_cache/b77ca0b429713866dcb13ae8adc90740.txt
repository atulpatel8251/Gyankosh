EVENTS AND PROCESSES      Se     oden
In Section I, you will read about the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution,
and the rise of Nazism. In different ways all these events were\important in the
making of the modern world.
Chapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we oftenstake the ideas of liberty,
freedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas
also have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part
of that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A
society based on privileges gave-way to a new system of governance. The Declaration
of the Rights of Man.during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.
The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a
new language of polities. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central
ideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought
in many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and
South America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in
a language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.
In Chapter IT, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic
events that foreed the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian
Revolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of
economic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell
you about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems
it faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with
industrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens
that were essential to the working of a democratic society. The ideals of socialism,

however, became part of the anti-colonial movements in different countries. Today
the Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth
century it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.
Chapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the
politics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,
about schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various
minorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings
to persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and
socialism. But the story of Nazism’s rise is not only about a few specific events,
about massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening
system which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the
ideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.
The history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom
and democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.

spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.
Some 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and
decided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of
government buildings in search of arms.
Finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern
part of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they
hoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,                                                                                      c

rich and others poor.
Fig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.
Peasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,
only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About
60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other
richer members of the third estate. The members of the first two
EB estates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by

programmes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about
a change in the social and economic order. This was left to those
groups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had
access to education and new ideas.
The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,
दि   termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an
5    expanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as
5    woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the
a oricher members of society. In addition to merchants and
z    manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers
पु    or administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed
=   that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a
&   person’s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas
2   envisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and
opportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John
Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Tio Treatises of Government,
Locke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right

of the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a
form of government based on a social contract between people
and their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu
proposed a division of power within the government between
the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of
government was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen
colonies declared their independence from Britain. The American
constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important
example for political thinkers in France.
The ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons
and coffee-houses and spread among people through books and
newspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the
benefit of those who could not read and write. The news that
Louis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the
expenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system
of privileges.

Accounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime
. Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in
793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:
‘I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was. in the company of
important men ... Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a
post. It was impossible to find one at-the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the
army was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The
church too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a
sou. My old friends turned their backs to me ... the system had provided us with an
education without however offering a field where our talents could be utilised.’
2. An Englishman, Arthur Young, travelled through France during the years from 787 to
789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what he                             घर

Voting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according
to the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis
XVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of
the third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the
assembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. This
was one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers

2. France Becomes a Constitutional Monarchy
The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution in
79. Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These
powers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,
were now separated and assigned to different institutions — the
legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional
monarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.

Reading political symbols
The majority of men and women in the eighteenth century could not read or write. So images and symbols
were frequently used instead of printed words to communicate important ideas. The painting by Le Barbier
(Fig. 8) uses many such symbols to convey the content of the Declaration of Rights. Let us try to read
these symbols.

 France Abolishes Monarchy and Becomes a Republic

The situation in France continued to be tense during the following years.

Although Louis XVI had signed the Constitution, he entered into secret

negotiations with the King of Prussia. Rulers of other neighbouring

countries too were worried by the developments in France and made

plans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place

there since the summer of 789, Before this could happen, the National

Assembly voted in April द792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.

Thousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army.

They saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all

over Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise,

composed by the poet Roget de L’Isle. It was sung for the first time by

volunteers from Marsevlles as they marched into Paris and so got its

name. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.

The revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties

to the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,

women were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and

looking after their families. Large sections of the population were

convinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the

Constitution of 479] gave political rights only to the richer sections

of society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for

people who wished to discuss government policies and plan their

own forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of

the Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St

Jacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this

period, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell         \                    4 :         की

wearers of knee breeches. These Jacobins came to be known as the
sans-culottes, literally meaning ‘those without knee breeches’. Sans-
culottes men wore in addition the red cap that symbolised liberty.
Women however were not allowed to do so.

treason. On 2। January 4793 he was executed publicly at the

The period from 793 to [794 is referred to as the Reign of
Terror. Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and
punishment. All those whom he saw as being ‘enemies’ of the Souree 0

patties, even members of his own party who did not agree with    What is liberty? Two conflicting views:

them was the staging of festivals like this one. Symbols from civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome were used to convey

3.2 A Directory Rules France
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed the wealthier middle
classes to seize power. A new constitution was introduced which
denied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided                                           5
for two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,                                                                     a

Fig.72 - Parisian women on their way to Versailles.
This print is one of the many pictorial representations of the events of 5 October 789, when women marched to Versailles
and brought the king back with them to Paris.
From the very beginning women were active participants in the events
which brought about so many important changes in French society.
They hoped that their involvement would pressurise the revolutionary
government to introduce measures to improve their lives. Most
women of the third estate had to work for a living. They worked as     Activity

main demands was that women enjoy the same political rights as

men. Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 479] reduced

them to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be

elected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they

felt, would their interests be represented in the new government.

In the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws

that helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation

of state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their

fathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.

Marriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered

under civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by

both women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could

become artists or run small businesses.

Women’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.

During the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering

closure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities. Many

prominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.

Women’s movements for voting rights and equal wages continued

through the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.

The fight for the vote was carried out through an international

suffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries. The example of the political activities of French women

during the revolutionary years was kept alive as an inspiring memory.

Jt was finally in [946 that women in France won the right to vote.

3. The source of all sovereignty resides in the nation, which is nothing

q Abolition of Slavery

One of the most revolutionary social reforms of the Jacobin regime

was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The colonies in

the Caribbean — Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo — were

important suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar

and coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant

and unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.

So this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa

and the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.

French merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to             &

the African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.          i    a

| The Revolution and Everyday Life
Can politics change the clothes people wear, the language they speak
or the books they read? The years following 789 in France saw many
such changes in the lives of men, women and children. The
revolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that
would translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.
One important law that came into effect soon after the storming of
the Bastille in the summer of 4789 was the abolition of censorship. In
the Old Regime all written material and cultural activities — books,
newspapers, plays — could be published or performed only after they
had been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and
expression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and
printed pictures flooded the towns of France from where they
travelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed
the events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press      Activity
also meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each
