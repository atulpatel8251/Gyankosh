waves. In these waves the individual particles
of the medium move in a direction parallel to
the direction of propagation of the disturbance.
The particles do not move from one place to
another but they simply oscillate back and
forth about their position of rest. This is
exactly how a sound wave propagates, hence
sound waves are longitudinal waves.
There is also another type of wave, called
a transverse wave. In a transverse wave
particles do not oscillate along the direction
of wave propagation but oscillate up and down
about their mean position as the wave travels.
Thus, a transverse wave is the one in which

Sound is produced due to vibration of different objects.
Sound travels as a longitudinal wave through a material
medium.
Sound travels as successive compressions and rarefactions
in the medium.
In sound propagation, it is the energy of the sound that
travels and not the particles of the medium.
The change in density from one maximum value to the
minimum value and again to the maximum value makes
one complete oscillation.
The distance between two consecutive compressions or two
consecutive rarefactions is called the wavelength, A.
The time taken by the wave for one complete oscillation of
the density or pressure of the medium is called the time
period, T.
The number of complete oscillations per unit time is called
the frequency (v), ves.
The speed v, frequency v, and wavelength i, of sound are
related by the equation, v = Av.
The speed of sound depends primarily on the nature and
the temperature of the transmitting medium.
The law of reflection of sound states that the directions in
which the sound is incident and reflected make equal angles
with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of
incidence and the three lie in the same plane.
For hearing a distinct sound, the time interval between the
original sound and the reflected one must be at least 0.] s.
The persistence of sound in an auditorium is the result of
repeated reflections of sound and is called reverberation.

Sound properties such as pitch, loudness and quality are
determined by the corresponding wave properties.
Loudness is a physiological response of the ear to the intensity
of sound.

The amount of sound energy passing each second through
unit area is called the intensity of sound.

The audible range of hearing for average human beings is in
the frequency range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz.

Sound waves with frequencies below the audible range are
termed “infrasonic” and those above the audible range are
termed “ultrasonic”.

Ultrasound has many medical and industrial applications.

Exercises

=                 l. What is sound and how is it produced?

2. Describe with the help of a diagram, how compressions and
rarefactions are produced in air near a source of sound.

3. Why is sound wave called a longitudinal wave?

4. Which characteristic of the sound helps you to identify your
friend by his voice while sitting with others in a dark room?

5. Flash and thunder are produced simultaneously. But
thunder is heard a few seconds after the flash is seen, why?

6. A person has a hearing range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. What
are the typical wavelengths of sound waves in air
corresponding to these two frequencies? Take the speed of
sound in air as 344m 57.

7. Two children are at opposite ends of an aluminium rod. One
strikes the end of the rod with a stone. Find the ratio of
times taken by the sound wave in air and in aluminium to
reach the second child.

8. The frequency of a source of sound is 00 Hz. How many
times does it vibrate in a minute?

9. Does sound follow the same laws of reflection as light does?
Explain.

0. When a sound is reflected from a distant object, an echo is
produced. Let the distance between the reflecting surface
and the source of sound production remains the same. Do
you hear echo sound on a hotter day?

ll. Give two practical applications of reflection of sound waves.
