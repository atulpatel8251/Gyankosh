Field crops are infested by a large number of
weeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and
pests are not controlled at the appropriate
time then they can damage the crops so much
that most of the crop is lost.

Weeds are unwanted plants in the

°   There are several nutrients essential for crops. Of these,
some are required in large quantities and are known as
macro-nutrients whereas rest of the nutrients are required
in small quantities and are known as micro-nutrients.
Manure and fertilizers are the main sources of nutrient
supply to crops.

with a maximum input of organic manures, recyled farm wastes, and
bio-agents, with healthy cropping systems.
Mixed farming is a system of farming on a particular farm which
includes crop production, raising of livestock etc.
Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the
same piece of land.
Growing two or more crops in definite row patterns is known as inter-
cropping.
The growing of different crops on a piece of land in pre-planned
succession is called crop rotation.
Varietal improvement is required for higher yield, good quality, biotic
and abiotic resistance, shortening the maturity duration, wider
adaptability and desirable agronomic characteristics.
Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter,
feeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry.
Poultry farming is done to raise domestic fowls. Poultry production
includes egg production and broiler production for poultry meat.
To enhance poultry production, cross breeding is done between Indian
and exotic breeds for variety improvement.
Fish may be obtained from marine resources as well as inland
resources.
To increase production of fish, they can be cultured in marine and
inland ecosystems.
Marine fish capture is done by fishing nets guided by echo-sounders
and satellites.
Composite fish culture system is commonly used _ for
fish farming.
Bee-keeping is done to get honey and wax.
