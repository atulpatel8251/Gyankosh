The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction
between any two objects is proportional to the product of
their masses and inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them. The law applies to objects
anywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be universal.
Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.

°   The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies
on the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the
equator.
The weight of a body is the force with which the earth
attracts it.
The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration
due to gravity.
The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays
constant.

All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are
immersed in a fluid.
Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which
they are immersed, float on the surface of the liquid. If the
density of the object is more than the density of the liquid in
which it is immersed then it sinks in the liquid.

Exercises

Ie                  l. How does the force of gravitation between two objects change
when the distance between them is reduced to half ?

2. Gravitational force acts on all objects in proportion to their
masses. Why then, a heavy object does not fall faster than
a light object?

earth and a | kg object on its surface? (Mass of the earth is
6 x 074 kg and radius of the earth is 6.4 x [06 m.)

4. The earth and the moon are attracted to each other by
gravitational force. Does the earth attract the moon with a
force that is greater or smaller or the same as the force
with which the moon attracts the earth? Why?

5. If the moon attracts the earth, why does the earth not move
towards the moon?

6. What happens to the force between two objects, if
(i) the mass of one object is doubled?

(ii) the distance between the objects is doubled and tripled?
(iii) the masses of both objects are doubled?

7. What is the importance of universal law of gravitation?

8. What is the acceleration of free fall?

9. What do we call the gravitational force between the earth and
an object?

0. Amit buys few grams of gold at the poles as per the instruction
of one of his friends. He hands over the same when he meets
him at the equator. Will the friend agree with the weight of gold
bought? If not, why? [Hint: The value of g is greater at the
poles than at the equator.]

ll. Why will a sheet of paper fall slower than one that is crumpled
into a ball?

strong as gravitational force on the earth. What is the weight
in newtons of a 0 kg object on the moon and on the earth?
