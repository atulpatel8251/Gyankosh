onsider the following situations of daily life and think what happens
when —
milk is left at room temperature during summers.
an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
grapes get fermented.
food is cooked.
food gets digested in our body.
we respire.
In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
word-equation.
The word-equation for the above reaction would be —

The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (l.),
magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.

A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
the reaction.

. Writing a Chemical Equation

Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as —

Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

.4.2 Balanced Chemical Equations

Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.

In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (l.2) balanced? Let us
learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.

The word-equation for Activity .3 may be represented as —

The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation -

Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
sides of the arrow.

Element    Number of atoms in    Number of atoms
reactants (LHS)      in products (RHS)

Zn                 ३                      ह

H                 2                       2

oO                  4                        4

As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of
the arrow, Eq. (.3) is a balanced chemical equation.

Let us try to balance the following chemical equation —

Chemical Reactions and Equations                                                                                       3
2024-25
Step I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each
formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the
equation.
Step II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the
unbalanced equation (.5).
Element             Number of atoms        Number of atoms
in reactants (LHS)      in products (RHS)
Fe                                |                                    3
H                                2                                    2
[e}                                |                                    4
Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound
that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a
product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe,O, and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on
the LHS.
To balance the oxygen atoms —
Atoms of             In reactants             In products
oxygen
(i) Initial                 l (in H,O)                 4 (in Fe,O,)
(ii) To balance                    >4                                  4
To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient
‘Basa H,O and not H,0, or (H,0),. Now the partly balanced equation
becomes —
Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements
to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced
equation.
To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.
Atoms of                     In reactants                 In products
hydrogen
(i) Initial                    8 (in 4 H,O)                 2 (in H,)
(ij) To balance                 8                      2x4
The equation would be -
4                                                                                                                              Science
2024-25
Step ४: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element
which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be
balanced, that is, iron.

(@ Initial                    l (in Fe)             3 (in Fe,O,)

(ii) To balance                          x3                              3

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.

Step VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.

The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (.9) are

equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical
equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance
the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.
Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine
the above balanced Eq. (].9. Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has
been given in this equation about their physical states.

To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states
of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical
formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants
and products are represented by the notations (g), (I), (aq) and (s),
respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product
is present as a solution in water.

The balanced Eq. (.9) becomes

Note that the symbol (g) is used with H,O to indicate that in this
reaction water is used in the form of steam.

Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless
it is necessary to specify them.

Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,
catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow
in the equation. For example न
Using these steps, can you balance Eq. (.2) given in the text earlier?

4.8 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS
We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single
product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product
is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.

A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction .3 is used for whitewashing
walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin
layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to
three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note
that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO,.

Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.
@) Burning of coal
(ii) Formation of water from H,(g) and O,(g)
In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.
In Activity ].4., we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.
This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is
released along with the formation of products are called exothermic
chemical reactions.
Other examples of exothermic reactions are —
(i) Burning of natural gas
(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?
We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy
from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler
substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain
carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.
This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides
energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of
which you will study in Chapter 6.
(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an
example of an exothermic reaction.

heat is given out along with the formation of a single product.

and of smelling the
odour

In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down
to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous
sulphate crystals (FeSO,. 7H,O) lose water when heated and the colour
of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe,O,),
sulphur dioxide (SO,) and sulphur trioxide (SO,). Ferric oxide is a solid,
while SO, and SO, are gases.

Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in
various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has
many uses - one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition
reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

What form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions?
We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either
in the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants.
Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic
reactions.

Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour
of copper sulphate solution fades?
The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity—
In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,
copper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as
displacement reaction.
Other examples of displacement reactions are
Zinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace
copper from its compounds.

What causes this? The white precipitate of BaSO, is formed by the
reaction of SO} and Ba?*. The other product formed is sodium chloride
which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an
exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
reactions.

=a                                This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.

Oxidation of copper to

copper oxice                          If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black
coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place
and copper is obtained.

Ifa substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.

During this reaction (.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
or redox reactions.

Some other examples of redox reactions are:

In reaction (].3) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.

In reaction (.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl, whereas MnO, is reduced to MnCl.
From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen
or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses
oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.
Recall Activity उ.उ, where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)
and changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide. Is magnesium being oxidised or
reduced in this reaction?

4.3 HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION

REACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?

4.3.4 Corrosion

You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get

coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process

is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get

tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating

formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances

around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this

process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green

coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.

Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
Chapter 3.

.3.8 Rancidity
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
for a long time?

When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation
(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as
nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?
