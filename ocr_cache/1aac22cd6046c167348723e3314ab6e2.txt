Census
Acensus is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India, the first census was held in the year
872. The first complete census, however, was taken in the year 88l. Since then, censuses have been held
regularly every tenth year.
The Indian Census is the most comprehensive source of demographic, social and economic data. Have you
