In the previous chapter, we noted that vertical division of power among
different levels of government is one of the major forms of power-sharing
in modern democracies. In this chapter, we focus on this form of power-              VD)

c   bel     w Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the

Ue ¢ e* them said:
Khag Raj: I don’t like federalism. It would lead to reservation of seats for
different caste groups as in India.
Sarita: Ours in not a very big country. We don’t need federalism.
Babu Lal: I am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get
their own state government.
Ram Ganesh: I like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier
enjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.

An experiment in Brazil
A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary experiment
in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up
a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local
inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 43 lakh people in this
city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided
into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of
the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are
some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city
can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these
meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision
about it.

About 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year.
This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit
of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and
builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them.

In our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in
Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development
of their locality.

This new system of local increased women’s representation
government is the largest experiment and voice in our democracy. At
