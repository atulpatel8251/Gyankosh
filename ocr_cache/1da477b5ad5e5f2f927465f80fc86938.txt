.2 On the Plateaus, Plains and Deserts Sm
Not all pastoralists operated in the mountains. They were also to be
found in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.
Dhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.
In the early twentieth century their population in this region was
estimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were
blanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar
shepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the
monsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor
soil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like
bajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast
grazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars
harvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march
of about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing
agricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds

In Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was
covered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep
herders. The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared
sheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,
cultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades
and took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it
was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of
their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and
dry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and
left when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet
conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Other
herds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.
Banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were
to be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland
for their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle
and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.

The accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral

groups. In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the

Gollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:

‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,    “Activity

where they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their   LS

Raikas also display their expertise in training their camels. Horses from Gujarat are also brought for sale at this fair.
So we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a
careful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how
long the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could
find water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their
movements, and ensure that they could move through different
territories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the
way, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the
soil. They combined a range of different activities — cultivation, trade,
and herding — to make their living.
How did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?

of its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue
collection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,
wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in
England. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to
be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural
produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules
uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.
These individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged
to settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages
in the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over
were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So
expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures
and a problem for pastoralists.

peaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were
considered to be criminal. In 87], the colonial government in
India passed the Criminal Tribes Act. By this Act many
communities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified
as Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature
and birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were
expected to live only in notified village settlements. They were
not allowed to move out without a permit. The village police
kept a continuous watch on them.
Fourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government
looked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed
on land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on
animals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed
on the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was

2. How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists? =
These measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. When grazing
lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available
area of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests
meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture
their cattle in the forests.
As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal
stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to
continuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic
pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another
area. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural
restoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed
on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used
and the quality of patures declined. This in turn created a further
shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.
Underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.

2.2 How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes? mam

Pastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some

reduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not

enough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new

pastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.

After 4947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could

no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of

the Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries

between India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had

to find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating

to Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the

harvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that

the animals provide.

Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and

settling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled

peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.

Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from

moneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep

and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.

Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions

their numbers have expanded over recent decades. When

pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the

direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined

pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the

changes in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry

regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the

most viable form of life.

Such changes were not experienced only by pastoral communities

in India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement                                                               =

patterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did                                                  3

|Pastoralism in Africa
Let us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population
lives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of
pastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like
Bedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of
them now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed
agriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and
donkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also
earn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity
with agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement
their meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.
Like pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed
dramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods. What have
these changes been?

Forced by changing conditions, the Maasai have grown dependent on food produced in other areas such as maize meal,
rice, potatoes, cabbage. Traditionally the Maasai frowned upon this. Maasai believed that tilling the land for crop farming is a
crime against nature. Once you cultivate the land, it is no longer suitable for grazing. Courtesy: The Massai Association.

The inset shows the location of the Maasais in Kenya and Tanzania.
We will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral
community — the Maasai — in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders
live primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another
[50,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took
away their land and restricted their movement. This affected their
lives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.

south Kenya and north Tanzania. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent
of their pre-colonial lands. They were confined to an arid zone with
uncertain rainfall and poor pastures.
From the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government
in east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand
cultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into
cultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had
dominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and
politically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.
Large areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like
the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti
Park in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these
reserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in
these areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that had
traditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. The
Serengeti National Park, for instance, was created over [4,700 km.
of Maasai grazing land.

Pastoral communities elsewhere in Africa faced similar problems.
In Namibia, in south-west Africa, the Kaokoland herders
traditionally moved between Kaokoland and nearby
Ovamboland, and they sold skin, meat and other trade
products in neighbouring markets. All this was stopped with
the new system of territorial boundaries that restricted                                   2

In most places in colonial Africa, the police were given instructions to keep a
watch on the movements of pastoralists, and prevent them from entering white
areas. The following is one such instruction given by a magistrate to the police,
in south-west Africa, restricting the movements of the pastoralists of Kaokoland
in Namibia:
‘Passes to enter the Territory should not be given to these Natives unless
exceptional circumstances necessitate their entering ... The object of the above
proclamation is to restrict the number of natives entering the Territory and to
keep a check on them, and ordinary visiting passes should therefore never be
issued to them.’
‘Kaokoveld permits to enter’, Magistrate to Police Station Commanders of Outjo
and Kamanjab, 24 November, 937.
The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created
pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined
within. Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a
deterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short
supply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.
3.2 The Borders are Closed Si
In the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast
areas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one
place they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From the
late nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing
various restrictions on their mobility.
Like the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within
the confines of special reserves. The boundaries of these reserves
became the limits within which they could now move. They were
not allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.
z    And it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment.
a    Those found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished.
हि
द्     Pastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas.
E   In many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any
&     form of trade. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists
=    as dangerous and savage — people with whom all contact had to be
=    minimised. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible,
=)) because white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines
=    and, build roads and towns.
The new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them
suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. This adversely affected

both their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not
only looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The
restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading
activities but they were now subject to various restrictions.
3.3 When Pastures Dry
Drought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail
and pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be
moved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,
pastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This
nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.
But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a
fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving
in search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands
and forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.
Since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were
available, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease
in these years of drought. An enquiry in 4930 showed that the Maasai
in Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 7,000 donkeys.
In just two years of severe drought, |933 and [934, over half the
cattle in the Maasai Reserve died.
As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts              लि
increased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline           aS                 .

To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced
a series of measures that had important implications. They
appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were
made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British
imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.
Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and
warriors was adversely affected.
The chiefs appointed by the colonial government often
accumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with
which they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent
money to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many
of them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.
Their wives and children stayed back in the villages to look
after the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the
=   devastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and
2    non-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock
हु   was depleted.

5    on their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have

=   they lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work
s     in the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others

The social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels.
First, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders

|
and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down
entirely. Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor
pastoralists developed.
Conclusion
So we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world
are affected in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern
world. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their
movement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,
pastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture
lands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that
remain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of
drought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.
Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of
their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights
to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for
relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in
the management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not
relics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the
modern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly
come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is
perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.
