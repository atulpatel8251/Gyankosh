We know that the area of triangle when its height is given, is 3 x base x height. Now
suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height.
Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40
m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want to apply the
formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate
the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section.
Heron was born in about |0AD possibly in Alexandria in                           लि
Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on                  ses

in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with            5

derived the famous formula for the area of atriangle in Heron (0 C.E.—75 C.E.)
terms of its three sides.
The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Heros
formula. It is stated as:
Area of a triangle = a/s(s— a) (s — b) (5 —€)              ()
2024-25
where a, b and 2 are the sides of the triangle, and s = semi-perimeter, i.e., half the
atb+e
perimeter of the triangle = >

This formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle
easily. Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned
above (see Fig. !0.2).

Let us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,
4    24 + 32
so that we have s = ee m= 48 m.

s—a=(48—40) m=8 m,

s—b=(48—24) m= 24m,

s—c=(48 —32)m=l6m.

Therefore, area of the park ABC

= Js(s-a) (5-5) (se)

= 48 x 8 x 24 x 6m? = 384m?

We see that 32? + 24? = [024 + 576 = 600 = 40°. Therefore, the sides of the park
make a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse
and the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90°.

We can check that the area of the park is 5 x 32 x 24 mn? = 384 m’.

We find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron’s
formula.

Now using Heron’s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other
triangles discussed earlier viz.,

(i) equilateral triangle with side [0 cm.

(ii) isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.

You will see that

Let us now solve some more examples:

Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and |] cm and

the perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. [0.3).
Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and b= [| cm.

Third side c = 32 cm— (8+ ]) ला न ]3 cm
So,      2s = 32,i.e.,5=l6cm,

s—a=(l6-8)cm=8cm,

s—b= (6-Il)cm=5 cm,

s—c= (l6-3)cm=3 cm.

Therefore, area of the triangle = नव) (न) नदी

A triangular park ABC has sides !20m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. [0.4). A
gardener Dhania has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How
much area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the
rate of 20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side.

For finding area of the park, we have
2s = 50m+ 80 m+ l20 m=250 m.
i.e.,        s= |25व
Now, s-—a= (25- [20) ए न 5,
s—b= (25-—80)m=45 m,
s—c= (25-—50)m=75 m.

Therefore, area of the park = s(s -a) (s 6) (नदीs(s —a)(s —b)(s —c)
= 25 «5x 45x 75 [25 > 5x 45x 75 पार
= 3755 m?
Also, perimeter of the park = AB + BC + CA=250m
Therefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m — 3 m (to be left for gate)
= 247m
And so the cost of fencing = %20 x 247 = 4940
The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter
is 300 m. Find its area.
Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3x, 5x and 7x (see Fig. 0.5).
Then, we know that 3x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle)
Therefore, |5x = 300, which gives x = 20.
So the sides of the triangle are 3 x 20 m, 5 x 20 mand 7 x 20m
i.e., 60m, l00 mand 40 m.
