Tissue is a group of cells similar in structure and function.
Plant tissues are of two main types - meristematic and
permanent.
Meristematic tissue is the dividing tissue present in the
growing regions of the plant.
Permanent tissues are derived from meristematic tissue once
they lose the ability to divide. They are classified as simple
and complex tissues.
Parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma are three types
of simple tissues. Xylem and phloem are types of complex
tissues.
Animal tissues can be epithelial, connective, muscular and
nervous tissue.
Depending on shape and function, epithelial tissue is
classified as squamous, cuboidal, columnar, ciliated and
glandular.
TISSUES                                                                             69
