CHAPTER 3
OVERVIEW
In Chapter ] we have seen that in a democracy it is neither possible nor
necessary for people to govern directly. The most common form of
democracy in our times is for the people to govern through their
representatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives
are elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and
useful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition
among parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an
election democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic
elections from non-democratic elections.

The rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of
this yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing
of boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At
each stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.
Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether
elections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of the
Election Commission in ensuring free and fair elections.

Code of Conduct: A set of norms and guidelines to be followed by    लि नर
political parties and contesting candidates during election time.         GLOSSARY |
Constituency: Voters in a geographical area who elect a representative to
the legislative bodies.
Incumbent: The current holder of a political office. Usually the choice for
the voters in elections is between the incumbent party or candidate and
those who oppose them.
Level playing field: Condition in which all parties and candidates
contesting in an election have equal opportunities to appeal for votes and
to carry out election campaign.
Rigging: Fraud and malpractices indulged by a party or candidate to
increase its votes. It includes stuffing ballot boxes by a few persons using
the votes of others; recording multiple votes by the same person; and
bribing or coercing polling officers to favour a candidate.
Turnout: The percentage of eligible voters who cast their votes in an election.

and arrange them in a time sequence, beginning with the first activity
and ending with the last. Some of these activities are given below:
releasing election manifestos; counting of votes; making of voters’
list; election campaign; declaration of election results; casting of votes;
ordering of re-poll; announcing election schedule; filing nomination.

7    Can we draw the following conclusions from the information given
in this chapter? Give two facts to support your position for each of
these.

a Election Commission of India does not have enough powers to
conduct free and fair elections in the country.

b There is a high level of popular participation in the elections in
our country.

ce It is very easy for the party in power to win an election.

d Many reforms are needed to make our elections completely free
and fair.

held guilty of practicing untouchability. The court did not allow either
of them to contest elections. Does this decision go against the
principles of democratic elections?

9     Here are some reports of electoral malpractices from different parts of
the world. Is there anything that these countries can learn from India
to improve their elections? What would you suggest in each case?
