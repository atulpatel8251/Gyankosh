CHAPTER 4
WORKING OF
INSTITUTIONS
OVERVIEW
Democracy is not just about people electing their rulers. In a democracy
the rulers have to follow some rules and procedures. They have to work
with and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such
institutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the
manner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our
country. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are
resolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key
role in major decisions - legislature, executive and judiciary.

You have already read something about these institutions in earlier
classes. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking
larger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this
institution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?
What makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective
here is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the
work of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions
in other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the
working of the national level government called Central Government, Union
Government, or just Government of India. While reading this chapter, you
can think of and discuss examples from the working of the government in
your state.

Civil Posts/ Services.
In a multiple undulating society like ours, early achievement of the objective of social
justice as enshrined in the Constitution is a must. The Second Backward Classes Commission,
called the MANDAL COMMISSION, was established by the then Government with this          |
purpose in view, which submitted its report to the Government of India on 3I“ December,
980.
2.    Government have carefully considered the report and the recommendations of the
i        Commission in the present context regarding the benefits to be extended to the socially and
educationally backward classes as opined by the Commission and are of the clear view that at                |
the outset certain weightage has to be provided to such classes in the services of the Union
and their Public Undertakings. Accordingly orders are issued as follows :-
(i)      27% of the vacancies in civil posts and services under the Government of India
shall be reserved for 5880;

two students to act as leaders of two political parties. She gave them
an option: Each one could choose to have a majority either in the
mock Lok Sabha or in the mock Rajya Sabha. If this choice was given
to you, which one would you choose and why?

l0 After reading the example of the reservation order, three students
had different reactions about the role of the judiciary. Which view,
according to you, is a correct reading of the role of judiciary?

a Srinivas argues that since the Supreme Court agreed with the
government, it is not independent.

b Anjaiah says that judiciary is independent because it could have

conformist, but acts as a mediator between opposing parties. The
court struck a good balance between those who supported and
those who opposed the order.
