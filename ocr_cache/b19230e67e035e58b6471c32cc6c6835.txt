Overview
{|

With this chapter, we resume the tour of democracy that we started last

year. We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest

with any one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of power           cD)

among legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the design            ee

of a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of           ok

power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri           fae]

Lanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for

power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the need             हिंद बा

for power-sharing in democracy. This allows us to discuss various forms          | कि   )

of power-sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.

K  ails                of silence and Vetal was the pillion rider. As usual, Vetal
dilemma       started telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while
driving. This time the story went as follows:

“In the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His
parents came from different communities. His father was an Orthodox Christian and
mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan
city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its
capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among
themselves. One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.

At the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic

rules for power sharing among different communities. As per these rules, the country’s

President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister

must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed

for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslims. Under this pact,

the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek

unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came

to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to

respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.

Khalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition.

But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise

either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He

cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy. “Just hold

an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the

president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can’t we do that, like in

other democracies of the world?” he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of

the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace...”

The story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower

where they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly

and posed his customary question to Vikram: “If

you had the power to rewrite the rules

in Lebanon, what would you do? Would               |            ¥

दी Us ¢ e~ Here are some examples of power sharing. Which of the four types of power
sharing do these represent? Who is sharing power with whom?

Yabloko Movement, agreed to unite their organisations into a strong right-
wing coalition. They propose to have a common list of candidates in the next

4. The Mayor of Merchtem, a town near Brussels in Belgium, has

5. Read the following passage and pick out any one of the
prudential reasons for power sharing offered in this.
“We need to give more power to the panchayats to realise the
dream of Mahatma Gandhi and the hopes of the makers of
our Constitution. Panchayati Raj establishes true democracy.
It restores power to the only place where power belongs in
a democracy न in the hands of the people. Giving power to
Panchayats is also a way to reduce corruption and increase
administrative efficiency. When people participate in the planning
and implementation of developmental schemes, they would
naturally exercise greater contro! over these schemes. This
would eliminate the corrupt middlemen. Thus, Panchayati Raj will
strengthen the foundations of our democracy.”
