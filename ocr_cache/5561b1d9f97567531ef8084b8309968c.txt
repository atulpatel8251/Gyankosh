CHAPTER 5
OVERVIEW
In the previous two chapters we have looked at two major elements of a
democratic government. In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic
government has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair
manner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on
institutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are
necessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions
need to be combined with a third element — enjoyment of rights - to make
a government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working
through the established institutional process must learn not to cross some
limits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.

This is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by
discussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without
rights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do
we need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is
followed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental
Rights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can
be used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them? Finally
we take a look at how the scope of rights has been expanding.

Registrar told her, “You can’t write your name as Madhurima Banerjee

d/o A. K. Banerjee. You are married, so you must give your husband’s

name. Your husband’s surname is Rao. So your name should be

changed to Madhurima Rao.” She did not agree. She said “If my

husband’s name has not changed after marriage, why should mine?”

In your opinion who is right in this dispute? And why?
9 Thousands of tribals and other forest dwellers gathered at Piparia in

Hoshangabad district in Madhya Pradesh to protest against their

proposed displacement from the Satpura National Park, Bori Wildlife

Sanctuary and Panchmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary. They argue that such

a displacement is an attack on their livelihood and beliefs. Government

claims that their displacement is essential for the development of

the area and for protection of wildlife. Write a petition on behalf of

the forest dwellers to the NHRC, a response from the government

and a report of the NHRC on this matter.
0 Drawaweb interconnecting different rights discussed in this chapter.

For example right to freedom of movement is connected to the freedom

of occupation. One reason for this is that freedom of movement enables

a person to go to place of work within one’s village or city or to another

village, city or state. Similarly this right can be used for pilgrimage,

connected with freedom to follow one’s religion. Draw a circle for

each right and mark arrows that show connection between or among

different rights. For each arrow, give an example that shows the

linkage.
