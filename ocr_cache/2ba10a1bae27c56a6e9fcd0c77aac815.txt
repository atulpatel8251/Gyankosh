You have studied algebraic expressions, their addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division in earlier classes. You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic
expressions. You may recall the algebraic identities :
(x + yp =x? + 2xy + y?
(x —yP नजा 2xy +
and                                    wy =(x ty) -y)
and their use in factorisation. In this chapter, we shall start our study with a particular
type of algebraic expression, called polynomial, and the terminology related to it. We
shall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the
factorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic
identities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.
Let us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real
value. We use the letters x, y, 2, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2x, 3x, — x, -5x
are algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) x. Now
suppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) x (a variable) and we do
not know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So
the expression will be ax, say.

However, there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter
denoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular
situation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the
value of a variable can keep changing.

Now, consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.[).
What is its perimeter? You know that the perimeter of a square
is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is
3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 x 3, i.e., |2 units. What will be the
perimeter if each side of the square is |0 units? The perimeter
is 4 x 0, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x
units (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4x units. So, as
the length of the side varies, the perimeter varies.

Can you find the area of the square PQRS? It is
x X x =x? square units. जी is an algebraic expression. You are
also familiar with other algebraic expressions like
2x, x? + 2x, की न x? + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic
expressions we have considered so far have only whole
numbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this
form are called polynomials in one variable. In the examples
above, the variable is x. For instance, और जी + 4x + 7 isa
polynomial in x. Similarly, 3y? + Sy is a polynomial in the
variable y and है + 4 is a polynomial in the variable ४.

In the polynomial x? + 2x, the expressions x? and 2x are called the terms of the
polynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y? + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely, 3)”, Sy and
7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial =x? + 4x? + 7x — 2 ? This polynomial has
4 terms, namely, —x°, 4x?, 7x and —2.

Each term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in —x? + 4x7 + 7x — 2, the
coefficient of x* is —l, the coefficient of x? is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and —2 is the
coefficient of x° (Remember, x° = ). Do you know the coefficient of x in x? — x + 7?
It is—l.

2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, —5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials.
The constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important
role in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes.

|                           2
Now, consider algebraic expressions such as x + —> Vx +3 and aly + y’. Do you
x
||
know that you can write x + — =x +x'? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e.,
x
x! is—l, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial.
L                                        |

Again, Jx +3 can be written as x? + 3 . Here the exponent of x is > which is
not a whole number. So, is की +3 a polynomial? No, it is not. What about
aly +’? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).

2024-25
If the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or g(x),
or r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write :

D(x) = 2x? + 5x —3
g(x) =x =I

ry) =y +y+]

s(u) =2-—u-w + 6u?

A polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x!°° + x!” + ...
+x?+ x +4] isa polynomial with 5] terms.

Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x°, —5x’, y and घी. Do you see that each of these
polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials
(‘mono’ means ‘one’).

Now observe each of the following polynomials:

pa)=xtl  g@)==x, ORV HL Kw =U

How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only
two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’).

Similarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials
(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are

P(x) नजर +7,                                gx) न वजन,

कप न न प्र 2,                            tyy=yi+y+5.

Now, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x7 — 4x° + x + 9. What is the term with the
highest power of x ? It is 3x’. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the
polynomial q(v) = 5y° — 4)” — 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y° and the
exponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial
as the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x’ — 4x° + x + 9
is 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5y° — 4)? — 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero
constant polynomial is zero.

Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below:
(i) P- xt +3             (ii) 2-—y°—y3 + 2y8             (iii) 2
(i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial
is 5.
(ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8.
(iti) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x°. So the exponent of x is 0.
Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0.
2024-25
Now observe the polynomials p(x) = 4x + 5, q(v) न 2y, r(t) न ¢ + V2 and
s(u) = 3 —u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of
these polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a /inear polynomial.
Some more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x — |, V2» के , 2 न. Now, try and
find a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a
linear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will
be of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a # 0 (why?). Similarly,
ay + bisa linear polynomial iny.

Now consider the polynomials :

2
2x? + 5, ऊ + 3x +7, x? and x7 + 5%

Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called
a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 — y’,
4y + 5y’ and 6—y—y’. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four
different terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at
most 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any
quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax* + bx + 0, where a # 0 and a, b, ८ are
constants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay’ + by +c, provided
a #0 and a, b, c are constants.

We call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a
cubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x3 + , 5x3 +.2x°, 6x3 — x, 6—23, 2x3 + 4x? + 6x +7. How
many terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at
most 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax? + bx? + cx + d, where a # 0 and
a, 0, c and d are constants.

Now, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree |, degree 2, or degree 3
looks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural
number 7? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form

ax" + a, na ' + se + aiad + a)
where a,, a,, 4,,...,@, are constants and a, # 0.

In particular, ifa, =a,=a,=a,=...=a,=0 (all the constants are zero), we get
the zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial?
The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.

So far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have
polynomials in more than one variable. For example, x? +? + xyz (where variables
are x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p* + q'° + r (where the
variables are p, q andr), घी + v? (where the variables are 2 and v) are polynomials in
three and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail
later.

Consider the polynomial p(x) = 5x न 2x? + 3x — 2.
If we replace x by | everywhere in p(x), we get
p= 5x Up-2x (0) +3 x ()-2

So, we say that the value of p(x) at x = | is 4.
Similarly,        P(O) = 5(0)> — 2(0)? + 3(0) -2

(iii) p(t) नवीन 5°-P +6
The value of the polynomial p(t) at t= a is given by
p(a) = 4a*+5a-a@+6
Now, consider the polynomial p(x) =x — I.
What is p(l)? Note that: 9() न |-न0.
As p() = 0, we say that | is a zero of the polynomial p(x).
Similarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of g(x), where g(x) = x — 2.
In general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0.

You must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x — | is obtained by
equating it to 0, i.e.,x — | = 0, which gives x = [. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial
equation and | is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say | is the zero
of the polynomial x — I, or a root of the polynomial equation x - | = 0.

Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no
zero because replacing x by any number in 5x° still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero
constant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By
convention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.

Check whether —2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2.
Let p(x) =x + 2.
Then p(2)=2+2=4, p(-2) = -2+2=0
Therefore, —2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not.
Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + [.
Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation
P(x) = 0

Now,                    2x + | न 0 gives us x =-5
So, न ; is a zero of the polynomial 2x + [.

Now, if p(x) = ax + b, a # 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of
p(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x),
amounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0.

Now, p(x) = 0 means           ax+b=0,a40
So,                                    ax =—b
कि                                    b
L.¢.,                                       x= a .
So, x= पा is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zero.
Now we can say that | is the zero of x — |, and —2 is the zero of x + 2.
Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x? — 2x.
Let                   D(x) =x? — 2x
Then                      p(2)=2?-4=4-4=0
and                       p(0)=0-0=0
Hence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x — 2x.
Let us now list our observations:
(i) A zero of a polynomial need not be 0.
(il) 0 may be a zero of a polynomial.
ii) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero.
(iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero.

(vii) p(x) = cx +d, c #0, c, dare real numbers.
Let us now look at the situation of Example 0 above more closely. It tells us that since
|
the remainder, 7[-5) = 0, (2t + ) is a factor of q(d), i.e., g(t) = (2t + ) g(t)
for some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem.
If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > | and a is any real number,
then (i) x—a isa factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and ही) p(a) = 0, ifx —a is a factor of p(x).
By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x — a) g(x) + p(a).
Gi) Ifp(a) = 0, then p(x) = (x — a) q(x), which shows that x — a is a factor of p(x).
(ii) Since x — a is a factor of p(x), p(x) = (x — a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x).
In this case, p(a) = (a — a) g(a) = 0.
Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x? + 5x + 6 and of 2x + 4.
The zero of x + 2 is —2. Let p(x) = 2° + 3x° + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2x +4
Then,              p(-2) = (-2 + 3-2) + 5(-2) + 6
=-8+2-0+6
=0
2024-25
So, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x° + 3x? + 5x + 6.
Again,                              s(—2) = 2(-2) + 4=0
So, x + 2 is a factor of 2x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor
Theorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2).
Find the value of k, if x — | is a factor of 4x° + 3x? — 4x + k.
As x — is a factor of p(x) = 4x7 + 3° — 4x + k, p(l) =0
Now,                    p() = 4()3 + 30. — 4) + &
So,                        4+3-4+k=0
i.e.,                                  k=-3
We will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3.
You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like
x? + Ix +m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term /x as ax + bx so that
ab = m. Then x? + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic
polynomials of the type ax? + bx + c, where a ¥ 0 and a, b, c are constants.
Factorisation of the polynomial ax? + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as
follows:                                               3x?                            कि
Let its factors be (px + qg) and (rx +s). Then    x 3x = first term of quotient
ax? + bx +c = (px + q) (9 +s) =pr x’ + (ps + qr) x + qs
Comparing the coefficients of x’, we get a = pr.
Similarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr.
And, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs.
This shows us that 6 is the sum of two numbers ps and gr, whose product is
(ps)\(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac.
Therefore, to factorise ax? + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two
numbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example [3.
Factorise 6x? + 7 + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the
Factor Theorem.
(By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that
p+q=l7 and pq =6 x 5 = 30, then we can get the factors.
So, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are | and 30, 2 and 5, 3 and 0, 5
and 6. Of these pairs, 2 and |5 will give usp + q =7.
2024-25
So, 6x? ने इक +5 = 6x? के (2+ [5)ऋन 5

b. They could be +!otI +> +> के. Now, p I = i + W A + 4 ~ 0. But

For the example above, the use of the splitting method appears more efficient. However,
let us consider another example.
Factorise ] — 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem.

Let p(v) = . न S5y + 6. Now, if p(v) = (v न a) हुए — b), you know that the
constant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(v), we look at the
factors of 6.

The factors of 6 are |, 2 and 3.
Now, p(2)=2?-(5 x 2)+6=0
So, y-—2 isa factor of p(y).
2024-25
ही                                      L
Also, p(3) = 3?-(5 x 3)+6=0
So, y—3 isalsoa factor of y —5y + 6.
Therefore, y?—5y+6=(y—2)(v-3)
Note that y? — 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term —5y.
Now, let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not
be appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in
the following example.
Factorise जी — 23x? + [42 न 20.
Let p(x) = x3 न 23x? + वि न 20
We shall now look for all the factors of -!20. Some of these are ऊ ], +2, +3,
+4, +5, +6, +8, ऊ0, ऊ2, ऊ5, +20, +24, +30, +60.
By trial, we find that p() = 0. Sox — | is a factor of p(x).
Now we see that जी — 23x? + 42 — 420 = x3 — x° — 22x? + 22x + |200 — 420
नकल) — 22x(x न ) + [20(0 न ) (Why?)
न (न |) (न 22 ने 20) [Taking (x न ) common]
We could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x न.
Now x? — 22x + |20 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using
the Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have:
x? न 22x + 20 = x? न 2 न 09 + [20

From your earlier classes, you may recall that an algebraic identity is an algebraic
equation that is true for all values of the variables occurring in it. You have studied the
following algebraic identities in earlier classes:
(Qxtypaxrt 2xyty
(नी ar -2yty
r-y=(rty)O-y)
(x +a) (x +b) =x? + (at b)x + ab
You must have also used some of these algebraic identities to factorise the algebraic
expressions. You can also see their utility in computations.
Find the following products using appropriate identities:
(i) (x + 3) (x + 3)        (ii) (« — 3) w+ 5)
(i) Here we can use Identity I: (x + yy =x? + 2xy +”. Putting y = 3 in it,
we get
(x + 3) w+ 3)= (न 3P =x? + 2(x)(3) + BYP

(ii) Using Identity IV above, i.e., (x + a) (x + b) =x + (a + b)x + ab, we have
(x — 3) (x +5) = x? + (3 + 5)x + (-3)(5)

You have seen some uses of the identities listed above in finding the product of some
given expressions. These identities are useful in factorisation of algebraic expressions
also, as you can see in the following examples.
Factorise:

(i) Here you can see that
49a? = (7a), 25b? = (5b), 70ab = 2(7a) (5b)
Comparing the given expression with x? + 2xy + y’, we observe that x = 7a and y = 5b.
Using Identity I, we get
49a? + 70ab + 25b* = (7a + 5b)? = (Ja + 5b) (7a + 5b)

So far, all our identities involved products of binomials. Let us now extend the Identity
I to a trinomial x + y + z. We shall compute (x + y + z) by using Identity I.
Let x + y न. Then,

So, we get the following identity:

We call the right hand side expression the expanded form of the left hand
side expression. Note that the expansion of (x + y + z)? consists of three square terms
and three product terms.
Write (3a + 4b + 5c)’ in expanded form.
Comparing the given expression with (x + y + z)*, we find that
x =3a,y = 4b andz=Sc.
Therefore, using Identity V, we have
(3a + 4b + 5c)? = Bay + (व) + (Sc? + 2(3a)(4b) + 2(46)(5c) + 2(5c)(3a)
= 9a? + [60 + 25c? + 24ab + 40be + 30ac
Expand (4a — 2b — 3c)’.
Using Identity V, we have
(4a — 2b — 3c) = [4a + (-2b) + (-3c)P

So, we get the following identity:

Write the following cubes in the expanded form:

कतिऐ न कर ta, x" +... tFaxetaxtay,
where a), a,,4,,...,4, are constants and a, # 0.
yy G,, dy, -.., @, are respectively the coefficients of x°, x,x°, ...,x", and nis called the degree
of the polynomial. Each of a,x", क [नर '; ..., 4g, With a, #0, is called a term of the polynomial
P(x).

2. A polynomial of one term is called a monomial.

3. A polynomial of two terms is called a binomial.

4. A polynomial of three terms is called a trinomial.

5. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial.

6. A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial.

7. A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic polynomial.

8. Areal number ‘a’ is a zero of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. In this case, a is also called a
root of the equation p(x) = 0.

9. Every linear polynomial in one variable has a unique zero, a non-zero constant polynomial
has no zero, and every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.
