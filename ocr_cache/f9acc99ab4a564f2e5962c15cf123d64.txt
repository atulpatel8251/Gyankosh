|  Summary
Food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food
available, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there
is no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food
insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to
calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition
insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households
in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers
engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are
disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically
backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions
more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of
the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is
composed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In
addition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which
comprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya
Anna Yojana (AAY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food
security, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards
this direction.
