SECTION II
LIVELIHOODS, ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES
In Section II we will shift our focus to the study of livelihoods and economies. We
will look at how the lives of forest dwellers and pastoralists changed in the modern
world and how they played थ part in shaping these changes.
All too often in looking at the emergence of the modern world, we only focus on
factories and cities, on the industrial and agricultural sectors which supply the market.
But we forget that there are other economies outside these sectors, other people too
who matter to the nation. To modern eyes, the lives of pastoralists and forest dwellers,
the shifting cultivators and food gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as
if their lives are not important when we study the emergence of the contemporary
world. The chapters in Section II will suggest that we need to know about their
lives, see how they organise their world and operate their economies. These
communities are very much part of the modern world we live in today. They are
not simply survivors from a bygone era.
Chapter IV will take you into the forest and tell you about the variety of ways the
forests were used by communities living within them. It will show how in the
nineteenth century the growth of industries and urban centres, ships and railways,
created a new demand on the forests for timber and other forest products. New
demands led to new rules of forest use, new ways of organising the forest. You will
see how colonial control was established over the forests, how forest areas were
mapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed. All these developments
affected the lives of those local communities who used forest resources. They were
forced to operate within new systems and reorganise their lives. But they also rebelled
against the rules and persuaded the state to change its policies. The chapter will give
you an idea of the history of such developments in India and Indonesia.

Chapter V will track the movements of the pastoralists in the mountains and deserts,
in the plains and plateaus of India and Africa. Pastoral communities in both these
areas form an important segment of the population. Yet we rarely study their lives.
Their histories do not enter the pages of textbooks. Chapter V will show how their
lives were affected by the controls established over the forest, the expansion of agri-
culture, and the decline of grazing fields. It will tell you about the patterns of their
movements, their relationships to other communities, and the way they adjust to
changing situations.
We cannot understand the making of the contemporary world unless we begin to see
the changes in the lives of diverse communities and people. We also cannot understand
the problems of modernisation unless we look at its impact on the environment.

Take a quick look around your school and home and identify all
the things that come from forests: the paper in the book you are
reading, desks and tables, doors and windows, the dyes that colour
your clothes, spices in your food, the cellophane wrapper of your
toffee, tendu leaf in bidis, gum, honey, coffee, tea and rubber. Do
not miss out the oil in chocolates, which comes from sal seeds, the
tannin used to convert skins and hides into leather, or the herbs
and roots used for medicinal purposes. Forests also provide bamboo,
wood for fuel, grass, charcoal, packaging, fruits, flowers, animals,
birds and many other things. In the Amazon forests or in the
Western Ghats, it is possible to find as many as 500 different plant
species in one forest patch.
A lot of this diversity is fast disappearing. Between [700 and 4995,
the period of industrialisation, 43.9 million sq km of forest or 9.3
per cent of the world’s total area was cleared for industrial uses,
cultivation, pastures and fuelwood.

 Why Deforestation?
The disappearance of forests is referred to as deforestation.
Deforestation is not a recent problem. The process began many
centuries ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and
extensive. Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.
7.7 Land to be [MproVed झा
In 600, approximately one-sixth of India’s landmass was under
cultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population
increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,
peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and
breaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded
rapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged

Native Americans like the Lakota tribe who lived in the Great North American Plains had a diversified economy. They
cultivated maize, foraged for wild plants and hunted bison. Keeping vast areas open for the bison to range in was seen by
the English settlers as wasteful. After the 8605 the bisons were killed in large numbers.

7.3 Plantations बिका
Large areas of natural forests were also cleared to make way for
tea, coffee and rubber plantations to meet Europe’s growing need
for these commodities. The colonial government took over the
forests, and gave vast areas to European planters at cheap rates.
These areas were enclosed and cleared of forests, and planted with
tea or coffee.

 The Rise of Commercial Forestry
In the previous section we have seen that the British needed forests
in order to build ships and railways. The British were worried that
the use of forests by local people and the reckless felling of trees by
traders would destroy forests. So they decided to invite a German
expert, Dietrich Brandis, for advice, and made him the first Inspector
General of Forests in India.
Brandis realised that a proper system had to be introduced to manage
the forests and people had to be trained in the science of conservation.
This system would need legal sanction. Rules about the use of forest
resources had to be framed. Felling of trees and grazing had to be
restricted so that forests could be preserved for timber production.
Anybody who cut trees without following the system had to be

of shifting cultivation or swidden agriculture. This is a traditional
agricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South Ametica. It
has many local names such as /ading in Southeast Asia, mi/pain Central

Fig. 76 - Burning the forest penda or podu plot.
In shifting cultivation, a clearing is made in the forest, usually on the slopes of hills.
After the trees have been cut, they are burnt to provide ashes. The seeds are then
scattered in the area, and left to be irrigated by the rain.
Shifting cultivation also made it harder for the government to calculate
taxes. Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.
As a result, many communities were forcibly displaced from their
homes in the forests. Some had to change occupations, while some
resisted through large and small rebellions.

addition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,
the forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its
boundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources
within that boundary. If people from a village want to take some
wood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called
devsari, dand ot man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests
by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain
to pay them. Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of
villages in a pargana (cluster of villages) meet and discuss issues of
concern, including forests.
3.2 The Fears of the Peop!¢ ककया
When the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of
the forest in 4905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection
of forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Some
villages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition
that they worked free for the forest department in cutting and
transporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,
these came to be known as ‘forest villages’. People of other villages
were displaced without any notice or compensation. For long, Source & एप

Elders living in Bastar recounted the story of this battle they had heard
from their parents:
Podiyami Ganga of Kankapal was told by his father Podiyami Tokeli that:
‘The British came and started taking land. The Raja didn’t pay attention
to things happening around him, so seeing that land was being taken,
his supporters gathered people. War started. His staunch supporters
died and the rest were whipped. My father, Podiyami Tokeli suffered many
strokes, but he escaped and survived. It was a movement to get rid of
the British. The British used to tie them to horses and pull them. From
every village two or three people went to Jagdalpur: Gargideva and
Michkola of Chidpal, Dole and Adrabundi of Markamiras, Vadapandu of
Baleras, Unga of Palem and many others.’
Similarly, Chendru, an elder from village Nandrasa, said:
‘On the people’s side, were the big elders - Mille Mudaal of Palem, Soyekal
Dhurwa of Nandrasa, and Pandwa Majhi. People from every pargana
camped in Alnar tarai. The paltan (force) surrounded the people in a
flash. Gunda Dhur had flying powers and flew away. But what could those
with bows and arrows do? The battle took place at night. The people hid
in shrubs and crawled away. The army paltan also ran away. All those
who remained alive (of the people), somehow found their way home to
their villages.’
The British sent troops to suppress the rebellion. The adivasi leaders
tried to negotiate, but the British surrounded their camps and fired
upon them. After that they marched through the villages flogging
and punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. Most
villages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. It took three
months (February - May) for the British to regain control. However,
they never managed to capture Gunda Dhur. In a major victory

 Forest Transformations in Java
Java is now famous as a tice-producing island in Indonesia. But
once upon a time it was covered mostly with forests. The colonial
power in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there were
many similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia and
India. Java in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forest
management. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java to
build ships. In |600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4
million. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there
were also many communities living in the mountains and practising
shifting cultivation.
4. The Woodcutters Of JaV2 Fi
The Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters and
shifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 4755 when the
Mataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were
equally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,
it would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to
build their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the
forests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs
work under them. In ]770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch
fort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.
4.2 Dutch Scientific FOrCSt’) DI
In the nineteenth century, when it became
important to control territory and not just
people, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,                                                               नि

4.5 New Developments in Forest’) बा
Since the 49805, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to
see that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest
communities away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.
Conservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a
more important goal. The government has recognised that in order
to meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be
involved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense
forests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred
groves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai, etc. Some villages have
been patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in
turns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forest
communities and environmentalists today are thinking of different
forms of forest management.

> Plantation owners
> — Kings/British officials engaged in shikar (hunting)

2. What are the similarities between colonial management of the forests in Bastar
and in Java?

3. Between 880 and 920, forest cover in. the Indian subcontinent declined by 9.7
million hectares, from 08.6 million-hectares to 98:9. million hectares. Discuss
the role of the following factors in this decline:
> Railways
> — Shipbuilding
> Agricultural expansion
> Commercial farming

3            > Tea/Coffee plantations
