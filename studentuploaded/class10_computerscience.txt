Punjab School Education Board, since its inception has been engaged in an
endeavor to prepare text-books on various subjects at school level. This textbook
is one in the series and is designed to focus on students-centered learning for the
students of Computer Science. The book has been developed as per
recommendations of Punjab Curriculum Framework 2013 based on National
Curriculum Framework-2005, accordingly to which the school life of the students
needs to be linked to the outside world. The book is a step forward to move from

the traditional book-based learning to activity-based learning.

The need for study of computer science as a subject is increasing day by day
because in the age of scientific and technological advancement computer
education improves the work efficiency in every field to socio-economic life. With
the advancement of communication and information technology, computerization
is being done in every department. Computer Education has become mandatory to
have access to information from various departments, e-governance and internet
access in various aspects of modern life such as education, business, health,
transportation and many more.

Keeping in view such requirements, Punjab School Education Board has
implemented the guidelines of the Punjab Government to make the computer
science subject as a compulsory subject from Class VI to XII. Every effort has
been made to include requisite information accordingly to level of class tenth in
this book. Hopefully this book will be useful for students and teachers.

Punjab School Education Board acknowledges the sincere efforts made by
writers, translators and vetters for the preparation of this book. Board also
welcomes comments and suggestions for any further improvements.

1.3 Different Types of Office Tools
1.4 Online Office Tools

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Office Tools include some application softwares. These softwares are designed to make computer
users more productive and efficient at their workplace. Usually these tools/sofiwares are used to
create, update, manage documents, handle large data, create presentations etc. These tools help
users to save their large amount of time and effort. Lots of repetitive tasks can be done very easily
with the help of various office tools. Examples of such tools/softwares are: Word Processors,

Presentation Tools, Spreadsheet softwares, database management tools, graphics tools etc,
As the internet becomes an important tool for businesses, many new online office apps and tools

are being used all over, such as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drive,
Microsoft One Drive, Gmail, Google Forms ete.In this chapter, we are going to have a look on
some of these commonly used offline and online tools.

1.2 SOFTWARE ANDIT'S TYPES

Computer Software plays the role of mediator between the user and computer hardware. A
Software is a set of programs that enable a user to perform some specific task or used to operate a
computer, These are the softwares that direct all the peripheral devices on the computer system —
what to do and how to perform a task. Hardware and Software work together to accomplish a
task. Without software, a user can't perform any task on a computer. Software can be further
divided into mainly two types: Application Software and System Software.

1.2.1 System Software:

System software is a collection of system programs. These softwares are designed to operate,
control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. These softwares are usually
written in Low-Level Computer Programming languages, such as Assembly Language etc. Low-
Level programming languages have the capability to interact with the hardware 81 8 very basic
level. System softwares are generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. Some examples
of system software are Operating System (Windows, Linux etc.), Language Translators

(Compilers, Interpreter, Assemblers), etc.

1.2.2 Application Software

Applications softwares are also known as End-User Applications. These softwares are mostly
designed and developed to perform specific tasks for users. Application softwares are used by
users as per their requirements. Different users have different requirements. So, every user may
use different types of softwares according to his/her requirements, for example: a photographer
usually uses application software - photoshop to edit photographs, an accountant usually uses
application software - Tally for maintaining accounting records, office-users uses application
softwares - word processors etc. to prepare documents etc.

These softwares are usually written in various types of High-Level Computer Programming
languages, such as Java, Visual Studio .NET etc. These softwares reside above the system
software. Application software cannot run without the support of Operating System.

Various types of Office Tools also fall in the category of application softwares, Users use various
types of application softwares (office tools) in the computers at their workplaces (offices) to
perform office related specific tasks, such as creating word processor documents, spreadsheets,
presentations, graphics, sending the email, etc.

1,3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF OFFICE TOOLS

Application software that support users in regular office jobs like creating, updating and
maintaining documents, handling large amounts of data, creating presentations, scheduling, etc.
are called office tools. Using office tools saves time and effort and lots of repetitive tasks can be

done easily. Some of the software that perform these operations are —

1. Word processor Softwares
2. Spreadsheet Softwares

We have already learnt about many of these tools in very detail in the previous classes. So, we are

going to have an overview of these tools:

1.3.1 Word Processor Tools:
A software for creating, storing and manipulating text documents is called word processor. In

simple words, we can say that Word Processor is a software that is used to manage text documents.
User can create, update and format text files using word processor. A word processor is an
essential part of any office suite. A word processor usually runs on local machine as a desktop
application like Microsoft Word, but nowadays cloud based Word Processors like Google docs
are also used which makes it easier for teams to manage their documents on cloud.

Examples of some word processors are:
1. MS-Word: Retail Cross-Platform word processor
2. Word Pad: Retail Windows only word processor
3. Word Perfect: Retail Cross-Platform word processor
4. Google Does: Freeware Cloud Based word processor
5. Open Office Writer: Open Source word processor

1,3,2 Spreadsheet Softwares
Spreadsheet is a software that allows users to process and analyse tabular data easily. It is a

computerized mathematical and accounting tool. In a Spreadsheet, data is always stored in cells.
Acell is an intersection of rows and columns. Users can use functions and formulas very easily to
process data stored in the cells. Spreadsheets are usually used to maintain budget, financial
statements and sales records etc.

Examples of some spreadsheet software are:
1. MS-Excel: Retail Cross-Platform spreadsheet package
2. Google Sheets: Freeware Cloud Based spreadsheet package
3. OpenOffice Cale: Open Source spreadsheet package

1.3.3 Presentation Softwares
A Presentation Tool enables users to demonstrate information in the form of a slide show. This

information is broken into small pieces called slides. A series of slides that present information
about some idea or concept to an audience is called a presentation. The slides in the presentation
can have text, images, tables, audio, video or any other multimedia information.

Examples of some presentation tool are:
1. MS-PowerPoint: Retail Cross-Platform presentation tool

1.3.5Multimedia Tools
Multimedia is a form of communication that combines different forms of contents such as text,

audio, images, animations, or video into a single presentation, Multimedia tools allow users to
create multimedia applications/contents using various forms of contents. In offices, multimedia
tools are used to create and play business presentations, for employee's training purpose, for
advertising and documentaries. Adobe Flash, Media Players and Real players are the examples of
multimedia tools.

So far, we have introduced various important and essential office tools to perform different types
of tasks in office environment. Besides these, there are various other office tools which can be
used for communication (such as emails, group chat, video conferencing etc), cloud storage (such
as google drive, one drive etc.), various types of conversions (such as pdf to word, word to pdf, jpg
to pdf ete. ), file compression (such as winzip, winrar, 7zip etc.) ete.

1.4 ONLINE OFFICE TOOLS
As the internet becomes an ever more important tool for business, many new online office apps

and tools are being used all over. Online office tools are those office tools that are offered in the
form of web applications. These tools are accessed online using a web browser. It allows people to
work together worldwide and at any time. Such accessibility leads to web-based collaboration
and virtual teamwork. Some online office tools can be installed on office-computers, while other
are offered only as Software as a Service (SaaS). Of the latter, basic versions can be offered for
free, while more advanced versions are often made available with a subscription fee.

1.4.1 Common Online Office Tools:
Google apps for office work covers all our business needs and has the added advantage of getting
all our apps delivered from the same source. So, there are no concern of incompatibility. We are

also guaranteed about the security of our data and efficiency of the tools. Google Docs, Google
Sheets and Google Slides are the Google Apps that are commonly used as online office tools.

Files created in these Google Apps (Google Docs/Sheets/Slides) can be stored both online on the
Google cloud or on the user's computer, Access to these files is available from any computer with
an Internet connection and a fully-featured Web browser. The files created in Google
Does/Sheets/Slides may be viewed by other google groups and members with the file owner's
permission. These Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, and Slides)are also available as mobile apps on
Android and iOS and as a desktop application on Google's Chrome OS.

These Google Apps are included as part of the free, web-based Google Workspace (also known as
G Suite). Multiple people can work on the same file created in these Apps and Apps will save all of
them automatically. These Google Apps also offers the benefit of cloud storage. It means users'
files are saved automatically on an online storage, and these files may be retrieved even if our
computer's hard drive fails. Now, Let's take a look at these popular online office tools from Google
for our paperless office:

Collaborating on Documents with Others:
One of the best features of Google Does is the ability to generate a shareable link. Itallows anyone
with it to either view, suggest edits, or edit our document. Instead of sending a file back and forth
between collaborators, we can make edits and suggestions all at once, as if we were all together
working over the same computer in real time. The only difference is that cach person has their
own text entry cursor to use on their personal computer.
From the document that we want to share, click on the blue button “Share” to choose how and
with whom you want to senda link of our file, Here, two sections will be shown:

1. Share with people and groups: In this section, we can enter email addresses manually

to whom we want to send a link of our file through email.

1.4.1.2 Google Sheets
Google Sheets is a free online spreadsheet web application. It includes nearly all capabilities of a
traditional spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. It comes with excellent data analysis
tools along with powerful functions and formulas for performing calculations. We can also insert
charts, create pivot table reports and apply filters etc. in the spreadsheets. The sheets may be
viewed by other google groups and members with the spreadsheet owner's permission. We can
export the file in all major file types including .xlsx, .csv, .html, .ods, ._pdf, and .txt.
Opening Google Sheets:
Google Sheets is available on all devices and platforms; all we need is an internet connection and
a web browser (in the case of mobile, the applicable apps). Google Sheets supports several
different file types, including .xIsx, .csv, .html, .ods, .pdf, and .txt. making it easy to view and
convert Microsoft Office files directly from Google Drive.
Following are the steps to open and work with Google Sheets:

Online office tools discussed so far has their advantages and disadvantages too. An overview of
these advantages and disadvantages of using online office tools are given below:

1.4.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Office Tools:

Using online office tools has their own advantages and disadvantages, Some of the important
advantages and disadvantages are given below:

1.4.2.1 Advantages of Using Online Office Tools:

1. The cost is low. In most cases, there is no specific charge for using the service for users who
already have access to a computer with a web browser and a connection to the Internet.

2. There is no need to download or install the tools/software.

3. Online office tools can run on thin clients (N Computing) with minimal hardware
requirements.

4. Online office tools provide the ability to share files.

§. There is no need to purchase or upgrade a software license. Instead, the online office suite
is available in the form of Software as a Service.

6. Online office tools are portable. Users can access their documents from almost any device
witha connection to the Internet, regardless of which operating system they use.

7. Ifthe user's computer fails, the documents are still safely stored on the remote server.

1.4.2.2 Disadvantages of Using Online Office Tools:

1. Access requires connectivity—if the remote server or network is unavailable, the content
will also be unavailable.

2. There are speed and accessibility issues. Most of the available online office tools require a

high speed (broadband) Internet connection. That can be a problem for users who are
limited by a slower connection to the Internet.

3. The number of features available is an issue. Online office suites tend to lack the advanced
features available on their offline counterparts.

4. In the long term, if there is a subscription charge to use the service, the ongoing
subscription cost may be more expensive than purchasing offline software upfront.

5. The user has no control over the version of the software used. If the software is changed the
user is forced to use the changed version, even if the changed version is less suited to the
user,

6. The user is reliant on the service provider for security and privacy of their documents,

2.6 Formatting in HTML

2.1 INTRODUCTION
World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages. These
web sites/pages are stored on web servers. Each web site/page is given a unique online address
called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web pages that belong to a
specific URLis called a website, e.g., www. facebook.com, www.google.com, etc.
Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their
devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The contents in these web pages can be in the
form of text, digital images, audios, videos, etc.

Client (local computer)

Fig:2.1 Concept of World Wide Web
Web pages are designed and formatted in HTML, These pages are connected with each other by
links, which are also known as Hyperlinks. These links are electronic connections that connects
related pieces of information so that users can access the desired information quickly. These web
pages can be accessed by HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocols) using web browsers. In this

chapter, we are going to start discussion about the basics of HTML,

2.2HTML

HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. There are lots of version of HTML which are
being developed. From an initial version of 1.0 to the latest version of 5.2, HTML has developed a
lot. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has also maintained standards so that all browsers could
have a common standard to follow. HTMLS5 has developed a lot with new tags and the support of
form elements.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating
Web pages. A Markup language is a computer language that uses tags (<>) to define elements
within a document. These languages are used by web browsers to manipulate text, images, and
other contents of web pages, in order to display them on the internet. It is not a case-sensitive
language.

Hyper Text is the text which contains links to other web pages.
Using these links, internet users can navigate on the world wide
web, By clicking on these links, also called hyper links, users
are brought to new web pages. Here, the word hyper means it is

not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by
clicking on the available links.

2.3 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR HTML on Internet

There are no minimum system requirements for developing HTML programs. HTML
Programming can be done on any type of computer and with any operating system. We need
only the following software to begin with programming in HTML:

2.3.1 TextEditors:

Aweb page isa text file in which a hypertext is written according to HTML syntax. So, for making
web pages using HTML, we just require any simple Text Editor, such as Notepad (a built-in text
editor of window) etc.Some computers with different Operating-system have different text
editors, But all text editors are used to write and save texts in various formats,".html" or ".htm"

are the two extensions that are used to write and save HTML files using these text-editors.
Although, many advanced text editors are also available in the market for programming in

HTML, Notepad++, Dreamweaver, Sublime, NetBeans etc, are mainly used for writing and
editing HTML coding, Notepad++ is a free and powerful code-editor, It can be downloaded free
from the Internet (website: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), It has the convenience of Tabs and we
can edit & work with multiple files at the same time. Following figures show the interface of
Notepad and Notepad++ Editor.

Many specialized online apps are also available on the web to create and edit web pages such as
W3Schools Online Code Editor, OneCompiler, JS Bin, JSFiddle, Dabblet, CodePen etc. We can
also use these online editors to create web pages using HTML.(For more information about using

Online HTML editors, see the detail in Appendix-I.)

2.3.2 Web Browsers
To view the output of HTML program, we have to open it in the Web Browser such as: Chrome,

Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc. Internet Explorer is the inbuilt browser of Windows
operating system, while other web browsers should be installed explicitly. HTML code is
displayed by the browser converting it toa web page.

Fig: 2.6 Internet Explorer (Web Browser)

If we prepare HTML web page in the simple text editor (Notepad), then we have to open the web
page manually to view it in the web browser. To open the HTML document file manually using the
web browser, we usually use the Open dialog box which can be opened by pressing the shortcut
key Ctrl+0O,
But, in the case of Notepad++, we can do it from within the Notepad++ interface. To preview the
html code in the web browser, we can follow the steps given below:

1. Click onthe View Menu.

2. Click onthe “View Current file in” to open the submenu.

3. Now, click on the desired web browser that is listed in the submenu, to view the output of

HTML program.

We can also view the output of HTML program by right clicking on the tab and select Open in
Default Viewer.
If we are using Online HTML Editors for creating and editing web pages, then it implicitly too
provides the options to view the output of created/edited web pages.(For more information, see
the detail in Appendix-I.)

2.4 TAGS ANDATTRIBUTES
HTMLisa hyper text markup language; It has a predetermined set of markup tags (also known as
elements). These markup tags are special type of instructions that are used in HTML documents to
design web pages. Each tag starts with Opening Angle Bracket (<) and ends with closing angle
bracket (>). These tags instruct web browsers how they will format and display the contents ofa
web page. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content anda
simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But
some HTML tags are unclosed tags. Therefore, these HTML tags can be mainly divided into
following two types:
੪ Paired Tags: These tags are also known as Companion or Container tags. A paired tag
consists of two tags: first one is called an opening tag (<tag>) and the second one is called
a closing tag (</tag>). The text on which we want to apply tag's effect is placed in between

these opening and closing tags. For Example:
<b>Hello from
HTML</b>
Here,<b> is called opening tag and </b> ts called closing tag. We want to apply the bold
effect on the text “Hello from HTML” so this text is placed in between the opening <b>
and closing </b> tags.
e Unpaired Tags: These tags are also known as Singular or Stand-Alone tags, These tags do

not need to be closed. For Example:

<br>, <hr> tags etc.

These tags do not require any closing tag.
HTML tags can also have attributes. Attributes are used to provide additional information about

HTML tags. These attributes are always specified in the Opening tag. Attributes usually come in
name/value pairs like: name="value".Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation

marks. For Example:

pee
<॥1 align=“right”>Main Heading</h1>

In this example, we are using paired tag <h1> which is used to create a Heading of level one. Inthe
opening tag of <hl>, we are using align attribute having value “right”. Here, align attribute
23


Page_Number 28 ended
/n
Page_Number 29 started
provides additional information about the heading that it will be aligned to the right side. If we do
not provide this attribute, then <h1> tag will take its default alignment, i.e. left. So, to change the
alignment to the right side for heading tag, we used align="right” attribute.

Different tags can have different attributes. Some attributes are required for certain elements, for
instance: an <img> tag must contain a sre attribute, while for most of the tags. the use of attributes

depends on the requirement.

HTML is relatively easy to learn because every tag is predefined, so only we need to know the
work of tags and their attributes. HTML tags and attributes can be written in small or capital
letters of English Alphabets.

2.5 BASIC STRUCTURE OF HTML DOCUMENT

Basic structure of HTML Document can be mainly divided into two parts: head part and body part

as shown in the following figure:

</HTML>

Fig: 2.7 Basic Structure of HTML document

As shown in the above figure, HTML document begins with opening tag <HTML> and ends with

closing tag </HTML>. These tags contain everything inside the document, including the Head

and Body.<HTML-> tag acts as a root of the document, This tag should be only one for the entire

document. Following description shows the role of head part and body part in the html document.

₹ HEAD Part: This part includes header information about the HTML document, for example;
page title, information about meta-data etc. Meta-data refers to other information related to
the data available in the html page, such as keywords used by the search engines ete.
Information in the head part is used by the web browsers and even web servers, Head part is
defined by <HEAD> tag which is a container tag, It begins with <HEAD> tag and ends with
</HEAD> tag. This tag is always defined before the <BODY> tag, Different types of tags can
be used for different purposes in head part of html documents. Following are some commonly
used tags within the head part (within <head> and </head>) of the web page:

a 10000

Page_Number 29 ended
/n
Page_Number 30 started
Tag Description

<titlke> 115 used to define the title of the HTML document

<meta> 1115 used torepresent the metadata ofthe HTML document

<style> 1115 used to define the styles (CSS) for the HTML document

<seript> 1118 0860 to insert scripts (suchas JavaScript, php, asp etc.) in the HTML

document

<link> It is used to define the link for external resource (such as style sheet etc. that will

be used inthe HTML document

* BODY Part: This part contains all those contents that are displayed on the web page to the
end user. Body part is defined by the <BODY> tag which is also a container tag. It begins with
<BODY> tag and ends with </BODY> tag. All the contents, such as text, pictures, videos,
tables, lists, forms etc, shown to user is defined within this tag. Body of the html document
should start immediately after the closing head tag, i.e. </head>.

Note: CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is a style sheet language that is used for describing the

presentation ofa document written in a markup language such as HTML.

2.5.1 Creating a Web Page with Basic Structure of HTML document:

To create a web page, perform the following steps:

1. Openany Text Editor such as Notepad or Notepad++ ete.

2. If you are using Notepad++, Create a new file by clicking on File New or by using the
shortcut key Ctrl+N, while if you are using the Notepad, then it will automatically open a
new file for you.

3. Now, start typing a very simple HTML program code as shown in the example below:

S¥DOCTYPE html}
<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>
</head>

<body>
<hl>Introduction to HTML</hi>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</p>
</body>
</html>
Program2.! Simple Example of HTML program

4. After typing HTML code (Program 2.1) in the text editor, now save it using File Save or
using shortcut key Ctrl+S. Make it sure to type the extension (.html) of HTML document
after typing the file name, i.c. filename.html (for example: p1.html)

Every HTML webpage has such type of code. Let's learn about the code given in the Program 2.1:

<! DOCTYPE html>tag describes the version of html. It shows that the HTML document is
going to use version 5 of html. It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML
tags). The <! DOCTY PE> declaration is not case sensitive. This declaration will be used only if we

CM ———”——TTT—C “RENN 385°

Page_Number 30 ended
/n
Page_Number 31 started
want to use the HTMLS version for web designing, otherwise if we omit this declaration, then the
HTML4 version will be used by default.

In the Head part of above program, we are using only title tag. Title tag is a container tag. It
begins with the <title> tag and ends with the </title> tag. This tag defines the title of the web page.
Title of the web page should appear in between the opening and closing tag of the title tag. The
title appears in the title bar of the web browser when web page gets loaded in the web browser.

In the Body part, we have written a simple text message. This message will be displayed to the
end user in the main window of the web browser when web page gets loaded in the web
browser. We can even display more contents such as pictures, videos, formatted text, tables, lists
etc, in the body part of HTML document instead of only a simple message. For this, we have to use
different types of tags in the body part of the document.

2.5.2 Viewing the Web Page with Basic Structure of HTML document:

Once HTML document file is saved, it can be opened as a webpage in the web browser. If we
prepare HTML web page in the simple text editor (Notepad), then we have to open the web page
manually to view it in the web browser. To open the HTML document file manually using the web
browser, we usually use the Open dialog box which can be opened by pressing the shortcut key

Ctrl+0O.
If we are using Notepad++, we can open it in the web browser very easily. Just right click on the

file tab and click on the option “Open in default Viewer”. It will open the web page in the default
web browser as shown below:

2.6 FORMATTING HTML DOCUMENTS:

We have learnt about how to create a HTML document with a basic structure. Now, we will add
some more elements to the sample program of HTML. Let's discuss about the formatting of web
page contents using various HTML tags.

HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel of web pages. HTML
provides us ability to format text without using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). There are many
tags and attributes in HTML that helps us in formatting. These tags are used to make text bold,
italicized, or underlined. Following is the description about commonly used tags and attributes
that are used for formatting in HTML.

2.6.1 Bold, Italic, Underline and Strikethrough:
HTML provides us with the ability for formatting text just like we do it in MS Word or any text
editing software. Following tags are used to apply these formatting effects on text:
© Bold: The <b> tag is used to apply Bold effect on the text. It is a paired tag. Any text that
appears within <b>...</b> element, is displayed in bold format.
Italic: The <i> tagis used to apply /talic effect on the text. It is a paired tag. Any text that
appears within <i>..,</i> element, is displayed in italic format.
e Underline: The <u> tag is used to apply underline effect on the text, 1118 a paired tag. Any text
that appears within <u>...</u> element, is displayed in underline format.

੪ Strikethrough: The <s> tag is used to apply strikethrough effect on the text. It is a paired tag.
Any text that appears within <s>...</s> element, is displayed in strikethrough format.

Following program shows the use of these formatting tags in the HTML document:

<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>

2.6.2 Adding Line Break and Horizontal Line:

® Line Break: When any text is written in different lines by pressing the Enter key in HTML
document, then these line breaks are not considered by the browser, HTML will ignore the
line breaks and treat everything as simple content and put everything in a single line.

Therefore, HTML provides us a special tag to insert line break in our document.

It is the <br> tag which can be used to insert a single line break wherever required in the
document. This tag can be used to move the control to the next line. It immediately breaks the
text and starts the text in the next line. This tag can be useful for writing addresses or poems
etc, inthe HTML document. This tag is unpaired tag, so it doesn't have any closing tag.

® Horizontal Line: To draw a horizontal line in HTML, we use <HR> tag. Here, HR stands for
Horizontal Rule. It creates a horizontal line wherever it is used in the body of the document.
This tag is used for a thematic break or used for separating content from one another.
Following common attributes can also be used with this tag:

o align: It is used to change the alignment of the rule on the web page. If no value is
specified, the default value is center. The align attribute has no effect unless the width
attribute is set to less than 100%. This align attribut is value is set to left, right and centre.

o color: It is used to change the color of the horizontal line through color name or
hexadecimal value.

© Size: 1115 used to set the height of horizontal line in pixels.

੪ width: It is used to set the length of the horizontal line on the web page through pixels or

percentage value.

2.6.3 Heading Level Tags:
Users often view a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document
structure. HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. There are 6 levels of headings
in HTML. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the
less important <h3>, and so on, In simple words, the <h1> heading denotes the most important
and <h6> heading denotes the least important heading in HTML document. Search engines use
the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
When we place the text within the heading tags <hI>......... </hI> then it is displayed in the
browser in the bold format, and size of the text depends on the level of Heading.
By default, these headings are left aligned. If we want to change the alignment of these headings,
i.e. right, center or left alignment, then we have to use its attribute —a/ign. Consider the following
example:

ih = =&=&= = = =—S— —tt—‘“itO 20

2.6.4Making Paragraphs

The <p>tag is used to define a paragraph in the HTML document. It is a container tag, Any text
written in between <p> and </p> tags is considered as a paragraph. The <p> tag automatically
adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser. Ifa
user adds multiple lines in between the <p> and </p> tags, the browser reduces them to a single
line. Similarly, Ifa user adds multiple spaces in between the text of a paragraph, the browser also
reduces them toa single space,

We can also change the alignment of a paragraph using the align attributes of <p> tag. Here, the
align attribute can have /e/i, right, center and justify values for aligning the paragraph in different
ways. By default, paragraphs are left aligned in web pages. Following program shows the use of
paragraph tag <p> in the HTML document:

2.6.5 Superscript and Subseript Text:

The <sup> tag is used to add a superscript text to the HTML document, It is a container tag. The
content written in between <sup>...</sup> element will be shown as a superscript. Superscript
text appears 1811 8 character above the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
Superscript text can be used in mathematical equations. For example: x’y, here 2 is a superscript.
Superscript text can also be used for footnotes.

The <sub> tag is used to add a subscript text to the HTML document. It is a container tag. The
content written in between <sub>...</sub> element will be shown as a subscript. Subscript text
appears half a character below the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O to be written as H,O.

2.6.6 Working with Fonts:

To work with the fonts of text, we use <font> tag in HTML documents. The <font> tag plays an
important role in the web page to create an attractive and readable web page. This tag is used to change

the color, size, and face/style ofa text. It has the following three attributes:
© Color: This attribute is used to change the color of text using either hexadecimal code or named
color (i.e. black, red, white)
₹ Face: This attribute is used to change the fontface. If the user viewing the page doesn't have the

font installed, user will see the default font face applicable to the user's computer.
© Size: This attribute is used to change the Font size. Size can be expressed as either a numeric or

relative value. The range of accepted numeric values is from 1 (smallest) to 7 (largest). The
default size of a font is 3.We can specify the size using Relative values, such as +1 (increasing by
one font size than the pre-set font size) or -2 (decreasing by 2 font sizes than the pre-set font size)
ete.
To change any of the font attributes at any time within our webpage, simply use the <font> tag. The
<font> tag is obsolete in HTMLS.

2.6.7 Making Text Size Larger or Smaller:

HTML <big> tag was used to increase the text font size one level bigger than the document's base
font size or surrounding text size, such as from small to medium, medium to large, large to x-
large, etc. HTML <big> tag is no longer supported by HTMLS.

Similarly, HTML <small> tag was used to decrease the text font size one level smaller than the
document's base font size or surrounding text size, such as from x-large to large, large to medium,
medium to small, etc. HTML <small> tag is no longer supported by HTMLS.

Both of these tags are paired tag. Following HTML program shows the usage of these tags:

2.6.8 Monospaced Font

We know that most of the fonts are known as variable-width fonts because different letters
have different width. (for example: 'w' is wider than 'T'). Monospaced Font provides
similar space among every letter. If we want that each letter has the same width then we
should write the content within <tt>...</tt> element. The <tt> tag is the abbreviation of
teletype text. This tag is depreciated from HTML 5.Consider the following example

which shows the usage of <tt> tag:

2.6.9 Pre-formatted Text:
The <pre>tag is used to specify pre-formatted text. It is a paired tag. Text within <pre>.......</pre>
tag is displayed in a fixed-width (monospace) font. The spaces and line breaks in the text are
preserved,
The <pre> tag is usually used to display code, or a text (for example, a poem), where the author
himself sets the location of the lines relative to each other. Following HTML program shows the
usage of this tag.

2.6.10 Center Alignment:
So far, we have used the align attribute of various HTML tags to align the contents in the center. If

we want to align any content (text, graphic elements, tables and so on) in the center of web page,
we can also use <center> tag in the HTML document. The <center> tag is used to center the
contents horizontally in the HTML document. It isa paired tag, The content written in between the
<center>..,.</center> elements will be displayed horizontally at the middle of the page. This tag
is not supported in HTMLS5,

2.6.11 Marked Formatting:

If we want to mark or highlight a text, we should write the content within <mark>.....</mark>
tags. Consider the following example program which shows the usage of center and mark tags in

2.6,12 Serolling Text:

Marquee is one of the important tags introduced in HTML. It is used to create scrollable texts and

images within a web page. It scrolls either from horizontally - left to right or right to left, or

vertically - top to bottom or bottom to top. The <marquee> tag is a container tag of HTML. This

tag is deprecated in HTMLS. Following are some of the common attributes that can be used with

marquee tag:

¢ Behaviour: This attribute is used to define the scrolling type. Scroll, slide, alternate are the
possible values of this attribute

* Bgcolor: This attribute is used to set a background color for scrollable text. We can use
hexadecimal codes or named-colors as values for this attribute.

¢ Direction: This attribute is used to set the direction for the scrolling content. Up, down, lefi,
right are the possible values for this attribute.

e Height: This attribute is used to define the height for scrollable text. We can set its value either
in pixels or in percent,

* Loop: This attribute is used to define how many times the content will scroll. If we don't
define this, the content will scroll forever.

« Scrollamount: This attribute is used to define the scrolling amount at each interval in pixels,
Its default value is 6.

e Width: This attribute is used to define the width of scrollable width. We can set its value either

We can also format the body of the web page using the attributes of <body> tag. We can set the
foreground and background color of the body. We can also set a picture at the background of the
body. Link colors can also be changed. For all these settings, we have to use the attributes of the
<body> tag, Following are some of common attributes that can be used to format the body part of
the document.

® Background: This attribute is used to set the background image for the HTML document.
We have to set the url of the image to use the picture as background of the body.

3.1 Working with Lists
3.2 Working with Tables

In the previous lesson, we learned how to create and view HTML documents along with various

types of tags that can be used for formatting web pages. In this chapter, we're going to add various
types of lists and tables to our webpage. HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related
items in lists while HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
Let's begin working with lists and tables in the HTML document.

3.1 WORKING WITH LISTS:
HTML lists are used to present list of information in a well-formed way. In our daily life, we
usually use many types of lists, such as shopping list, To-do list etc. All lists may contain one or
more list elements. Articles, website navigation menus, and product features on e-commerce
websites, all make frequent use of lists. So, lists play an important role in defining important
information in the form of few lines.
In HTML documents, we can create and use three different types of lists:

1.Unordered List or Bulleted List

2. Ordered List or Numbered List

3. Definition List or Description List
Each of these lists has a specific purpose and meaning. In the following sections of this chapter,
we will cover all these three types of list one by one:

3.1,1 Unordered List:

An unordered list is a list in which the order of the list items does not matter, In this list, all the list
items are marked with bullets. That is why, unordered list is also known as Bulleted List. The <ul>
tag is used to create this type of list in HTML document. Here, UL stands for unordered list. The
<ul> tag is a paired tag. All the list items are placed in between <ul> and </ul> tag. Each item of
list starts with <li> tag which stands for List Item. We can also change the type of bullet with the
help of <ul> tag's attributes. Following example shows how to use the unordered list in the HTML
document:

Fig:3,1 Output of Program 3.1 in Internet Explorer

Attributes of Unordered List:
If we want to change the type of bullets for the unordered list, we can use the “Type” attribute of
<ul> tag in the HTML document. Following are the possible options for the type attribute:
<ul type = "square">
<ul type = "disc">
<ul type = "cirele">
By default, disc type of bullets is used for <ul> tag.

3.1.2 Ordered List:

Ordered lists are used when the order of the items in the list is important. This list is also known as
Numbered List because it displays list items in the numbered format. The <ol> tag is used to
create this type of list in HTML document. Here, OL stands for ordered list. The <ol> tag is a
paired tag. All the list items are placed in between <ol> and </ol> tag. Like the unordered list, each
item of the list starts with <li> tag. Following example shows how to use the ordered list in the
HTML document:

<html>

Attributes of Ordered List:

We can use ordered list to represent items either in numerical order format or alphabetical order
format, or any format where an order is emphasized. There can be different types of numbered
list:

a Numbered List with Numeric Numbers (1, 2,3)

੦ Numbered List with Capital Roman Numbers (III 111)

੦ Numbered List with Small Roman Numbers (111111)

੦6 Numbered List with Capital Alphabets (AB C)

੦ Numbered List with Small Alphabets (abc)

We can use Type attribute for <ol> tag to specify the type of numbering we like. By default, 1118 a
number. Following are the possible options for Type attribute to change the format of numbers
for ordered lists;

੦ <ol type ="1"> - It is the default-case numerals.

੦ <ol type="I"> - It is used for Upper-Case Roman Numerals.
੦ <oltype="i"> - It is used for Lower-Case Roman Numerals.
੦ <ol type = "A">- It is used for Upper-Case Letters.

੦ <ol type ="a"> - It is used for Lower-Case Letters,

We can also use Start attribute for <ol> tag to specify the starting point of numbering we need,
For example: <ol type = "i" start = "5"> will start the numbering of list items from the value “v”,
Following program example shows how to use the ordered list with Type and Start attribute in

3.1.3 Definition List:
HTML supports one more list style which is called Definition List or Description List.A
description list is a list of items with a description or definition of each item or term, In this list,
items are listed like ina dictionary. The HTML <dl> tag is used for declaring a definition list. Each
list item in the definition list contains two entries:

© Definition Title (also called Data Term): The <dt> tag defines definition title.

₹ Definition Description (also called Data Definition): The <dd> tag defines

definition description,

The <dt> and <dd> tags are used in between the <dl> and </dl> tags. There are no attributes that
can be used with the <dl> tag. Following example shows how to work with definition lists in
HTML document;

<html>

3.1.4 Nesting of Lists:
Anested list is also known as a sub-list. It is not any new type of list in HTML and no special tag is
used to create such lists. Simply, we can say that it is a list within a list. The nested list has to be a
child of the <li> element and not of a list. We can nest different types of lists, too. Following
procedure can be used to create nested lists in HTML documents:
1. Start by creating a list. It can be ordered or unordered. For example:
<ul>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>User</li>
<ul>
2. Now, suppose we want to add numbered subitems — 'System Software’, and ‘Application
Software’, under the List Item — ‘Software’. To do so, add an ordered-list to the list item —
‘Software’ to create a sub-list, as shown in the following HTML program:
<html>

<head>

<title>Nested List</title>
</head> Outer—
<body> Unordered list

<n2>Example of a Nested List </h2>

3.2 WORKING WITH TABLES

A table is a structure in which data can be arranged in rows and columns. Tables are widely used to
represent data in tabular form mainly for data analysis and research work etc. Information in
tables is easily readable and understandable. They provide an excellent method of compiling
lengthy and extensive information. All popular browser provides support for tables.

The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, etc. into rows and
columns.The cross-sectional area of rows and columns is called a Cell. Contents of a table are

shown in these cells, Following elements are used for working with tables in HTML documents.
e <TABLE>: The <table> is used to define a table in HTML documents. It is a

paired/container tag. Every table must start with <table> and ends with </table>, All the

rows and columns including data must be defined with in these table tags.

e <TR>: TR stands for Table Row. This tag is used to define a row in the <table> . This tag is
also a paired/container tag. Each row of table begins with <tr> and ends with </tr>. Table
Heading and Table Data are defined with in the <tr> and </tr> tags. For each row ofa table, a
separate <tr>...</tr> must be defined in the <table> tag.

e <TH>: TH stands for Table Heading. This tag is used to define the Table Headings. It is also
a paired/container tag which begins with <th> tag and ends with </th> tag. For Each Table
Header (Column Name), there must be a separate combination of <th>...</th> tags. These
tags must be defined with in the <tr> and </tr> tags. Normally, we will put our top row as
table heading, otherwise we can use <th> element in any row. By default, table headings are
bold and centered in the cell.

e <TD>: TD stands for Table Data. This tag is used to define contents/data of a cell. 1115 alsoa
paired/container tag. Cell contents/data must be defined with in the <td> and </td> tags,
These tags must be defined with in the <tr> and </tr> tags. The contents defined by <td> are
regular and left aligned by default.

e@ <CAPTION>: The <caption> tag will serve as a Title or Explanation for the table. Itshows
up at the top of the table. By default, a table caption will be center-aligned. The <caption>
tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag. If we want to define a Title for the
table, then we should use this tag, otherwise this tag is not compulsory to define the table.

Consider the following example ofa simple table:

Table: Student Information

If we want to create such type or wuie ॥੦॥ a wou page, uicn we cal use ue above-mentioned table

In the above example, table and its data are shown without any cell borders. If we want to set the
border of cells, we have to use the border property of the <table> tag. Besides border attribute,
there are many other attributes too that can be used with the table and its associated tags. These
attributes help us to format the table or to make changes in the structure of a table. Following

description shows how to use various attributes of table tags with suitable examples:

3.2.1 Setting Table Height and Width:
We can set a table width and height using width and /eighs attributes of <table> tag. We can

specify table width or height in terms of pixels or in terms of percentage of available screen area.

For Example:<table width="50% " height="200">.......</table>
In this example: 50% space of web browser window is used as a width of table. while 200 pixels
are set to define the height of the table in web browser window.
3.2.2 Setting Table Border and Border Color:
By default, no border is set for the HTML table in the web page. It is the Border attribute of
<table> tag that is used to put a border across all the cells. Border width is determined using a
number. For example, for a thin border, use the number "1". For a thicker border, use a greater
number. If we do not need a border, then we can use border="0".

For Example:<table border=“5">....... </table>
In this example, a thick border has been defined because value of border is “5” which is greater
than “1”
To change the color of table border, Border Color attribute can be used. Color of Border will be
shown only when border value has been set to greater than or equals to 1.

For Example: <table border ="1" bordercolor=“red”>.....</table>

In the example, a thin border has been defined with red color,
Following HTML program example shows the use of table properties that has been explained so

3.2.3 Setting Table Backgrounds:
We can set table background using one of the following two attributes:
e Bgcolor: This attribute is used to change the background color for the whole table. It could

also be used to change the color 018 table row ora table cell. Value of this property will be

color name ora hexadecimal color code.
For Example:<table hgcolor=“pink">....... </table>
e Background: This attribute is used to set background image for the whole table or just for

one cell. Value of this property will be the URL (location address) of the image with file

extension.
For Example:<table background=“hack.jpg”>......</table>
These attributes have been deprecated in HTMLS in favour of style sheets. Following HTML

program shows how to use these attributes in HTML document;

3.2.4 Setting Cell Padding and Cell Spacing:

Cell padding and cell spacing can be used to adjust the white space in table cells. For adjusting
these white spaces, two attributes ce//padding and cellspacing are used in table tags:

e Cellpadding: The cellpadding is an important feature to format and make table cells good.
Cellpadding provides space inside the cells. It represents the distance between cell border
and the content ofa cell. The default cell padding is | pixel.

For Example: <table cellpadding=“5">

e Cellspacing: Cellspacing is another important attribute for <table> tag in HTML. It
provides space outside the cells. Using cellspacing attribute, we can define space between
table cells. The default cellspacing is 2 pixels.

For Example: <rable cellspacing= “7”">

3.2.5 Merging Cells:

Merging cells mean combining two or more cells to make a single cell. Co/span and Rowspan
Attributes can be used to merge cells in HTML tables, These are the attributes of <td> or <th>
tags.

® Colspan; We will use colspan attribute if we want to merge cells of two or more columns

into a single cell, as shown in the figure: 3.11. Minimum value for colspan is 2.
For Example: <td colspan= “2">

@ Rowspan: We will use rowspan attribute if we want to merge cells of two or more rows into

asingle cell, as shown in the figure: 3.11. Minimum value for rowspan is 2.
For Example: <¢d rowspan=“2”>

3.2.6 Changing the Alignment of a Table or Cell Value:

We can set the alignments in two ways: Horizontally and Vertically. Table can be aligned only
horizontally while contents in the cells can be aligned horizontally as well as vertically in both
ways. Following discussion shows how to set the alignments of various HTML table tags:

3.2.6.1 Setting Horizontal Alignment:

We can set the horizontal alignment of the table and its cell contents using «/ign attribute,
Following description shows how to use align attribute for different table tags used in HTML
documents:

ਦੈ Align attribute for <table> tag: By default, tables are shown left aligned in web pages.
Using align attribute in the <table> tag. we can change the alignment of the table
horizontally. Align attribute can have either Right, Left, or Center value for <table> tag.

For Example: <table align=“right”>

®@ Align attribute for <tr> tags: By default, cell data in table rows are shown left aligned.
Using align attribute in the <tr> tag, we can change the horizontal alignment of the
contents for all cells in the row. Align attribute can have either Right, Leff, Center or
Justify value for <tr> tag.

For Example: <tr align=“center”>

® Align attribute for <td> and <th> tags: By default, cell contents of <td> are shown left
aligned while default alignment for cell contents defined by <th> is center. If we use align
attribute in the <td> or <th> tags, it will change the horizontal alignment of that particular
cell on which it is applied. Align attribute can have either Right, Left, Center or Justify
value for <td> and <th> tags.

For Example: <¢d align=“center”>

it &=&= = —=—  ——=—<s—(<ésS3;3; HCO 8

Page_Number 64 ended
/n
Page_Number 65 started
@ Align attribute for <caption> tag: By default, a table caption is center-aligned and
shown above the table. Align attribute indicates how the caption is aligned with respect to
the table. Normally, align attribute can have either Top or Bottom value for <caption> tag.
If we set align= “Top ', the caption is displayed above the table and if we want the caption
is displayed below the table then we can use align= “Bottom” value for the <caption> tag,
But, align attribute has been depreciated in HTMLS in favour of CSS style sheets.

For Example: <caption align=“bottom”>

3.2.6.2 Setting Vertical Alignment:

We can set the vertical alignment of only cell-contents using valign attribute. HTML valign
attribute supports <td>, <th>, and <tr> elements. Following description shows how to use valign
attribute for different table tags used in HTML documents:
® valign attribute for <tr> tag: By default, cell data in table rows are shown vertically
center aligned. Using valign attribute in the <tr> tag, we can change the vertical alignment
of the contents for all cells in the row, Valign attribute can have normally either 7op,
Middle, or Bottom value for <tr> tag.

For Example: <¢r valign="top">

®@ valign attribute for <td> and <th> tags: By default, cell contents of <td> and <th> are
shown vertically center aligned. If we use valign attribute in the <td> or <th> tags, it will
change the vertical alignment of that particular cell on which it is applied. Valign attribute
can have normally either Top, Middle, or Bottom value for <td> and <th> tags.
For Example: <td valign=“bottom’>

<html>

Till now, we have discussed in detail about the table tags along with their attributes. Now, we are
ina situation that we can work very flexibly with the data in tables. HTML tables are also used to
manage the layout of the web pages, c.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer
section etc. But, it is recommended to use <div> tag over table to manage the layout of the web
pages.
Note: All browsers do not support all tags and their attributes. Therefore, it may also be
possible that some tags or attributes may not work as expected due to compatibility issues of

web browsers, In such a case, try to run the HTML program in different browsers to get
expected output of HTML documents.

. HTML lists are used to presenta list of information in a well-formed way.

. In HTML documents, we can create and use three different types of lists: Unordered,
Ordered and Description list.

. An unordered list is a list in which the order of the list items does not matter. In this list, all
the list items are marked with bullets.

. The <ul> tag is used to create an ordered list in HTML document. Here, UL stands for
unordered list.

. Ordered list is also known as Numbered List because it displays list items in the numbered
format.

. The <OL> tag is used to create an ordered list in HTML document. Here, OL stands for
ordered list.

. Typeand Start are the two main attributes for Ordered Lists

. Anested list isa list within a list. The nested list has to be a child of the <li> clement and not

ofa list.

. The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, etc. into rows

and columns.

10. <TR> tag is used to define a row in the <table> tag. TR stands for Table Row.

11. <TH> tag is used to define the Table Headings. TH stands for Table Heading.

12. <TD> tag is used to define contents/data ofa cell, TD stands for Table Data.

13, Itis the Border attribute of <table> tag that is used to put a border across all the cells.

14. Bgcolor and Background attributes are used to format the background of a table in HTML
document.

15, Cellpadding represents the distance between the cell border and the content ofa cell.

16. Using the cellspacing attribute, we can define space between table cells.

17. Colspan attribute is used to merge cells of two or more columns into a single cell

18. Rowspan attribute is used to merge cells of two or more rows into a single cell

19. The horizontal alignment of the table and its cell contents can be changed using align
attribute.

20. The vertical alignment of cell-contents only can be set byusing the valign attribute.

4.3 Working with Hyperlinks

4.4 Working with Forms

4.5 Stages/Phases of Web Development

So far, we have discussed about the various tags and their attributes for developing web pages. We
have learnt about creating and formatting web pages, working with different types of lists,
representing and formatting data in the tables ete. In this chapter, we are going to discuss about
how to use images in HTML documents to make web pages more attractive, how to create
hyperlinks to access other web pages, how to accept data from user, and various stages of web
development ete. For working with images and hyperlinks, first 01811 we have to know about the
various types of resource locations and file-paths. So, in this chapter, we will start our discussion
from the topic URLs and File Paths.
4.1 URLs AND THEIR TYPES
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. URLs play an important role in
locating our resources on web server or local computer. In most cases, URL
refers to remote resources on server and a file-path refers to local resource
inside our computer. So, we can say any internet location available on server is
called a web URL or a web address, Each website or webpage has a unique
URL. For example: the website of Punjab School Education Board has web-
address or web-URL called http://pseb.ac.in/. On the other hand, a File-Path specifies the
location ofa file inside a folder structure on our local computer. It is like an address of a file which
helps us to access it.
Both URLs and File-paths are used to link external resources such as images, videos, style sheets,
other web pages etc. To insert/use a file in a web page, its source must be known. For example, if
we want to display an image on a web page then URL or file-path of that image must be known to
us to specify it in the HTML document. A web URL is made up of four basic parts:

e Protocol

9 Hostname

9 Foldername

9 File-name
For example: http://pseb.ac.in/ebooks/cs12.pdf


Page_Number 70 ended
/n
Page_Number 71 started
In this web-URL example, Aap: represents the protocol, pseb.ac.in represents the host name,
ebooks represents the folder name and cs/2.pdfrepresents the file name, Hence, this URL shows
us the complete location of a pdf file (cs12.pdf) which is located in the ebooks folder on the
website pseb.ac.in.
A File Path is made up of three basic parts—

e Drive Name

₹ Foldername

e File-name
For example: “D:\main\picture.jpg”
In this File Path example, Dz\ represents the Drive name, main represents the folder name and
picture.jpg represents the file name. Hence, this File Path shows us the complete location ofa jpg
file (picture.jpg) which is located in the main folder on the D:\ drive.
4.1.1 Types of URLs:
Basically, URLs fall into two categories: Absolute and Relative URL,
(i) Absolute URL:
An absolute URL gives complete location to a resource (file). Absolute URL contains all the
information necessary to find the files on the internet or on the local computer. Any URL written in
absolute type does not change when the location of requesting file or server is being changed,
Consider an example of file location which shows the local path of the file picture.jpg within

index.html file: *
“D:\main\picture.jpg” Cc A |

picture jpg

This example shows us the complete file-path location of a picture file (picture.jpg) which is
located in the main folder at D: drive of the computer system. Here, if we change the location of
index.html to the root directory then the URL still remains pointing to the file
D:\main\picture.jpg(A) regardless the root directory itself has a file picture.jpg (B).

D: (Drive)

(ii) Relative URL:

A Relative URL describes the path of the file relative to the location of the current web page file. It
usually contains only the folder name and file name or even just the file name. Here, a browser
doesn't need the server name or the protocol indicator. Its main advantage is that, this type of path
changes according to the requesting resource's own location at web server or local directory
structure. For example: if the path shown in the example of absolute URL is written as relative
URL then it changes accordingly when the location of index.html is being changed. We can
represent the same path in relative URLas:

" /picture.jpg" Cc | A

picture.jpg
When our index.html file is located in main directory then this path represents
D:\main\picture.jpg (A). But, if we change the location of index.html to root directory of the
same directory structure then the same path will start representing D:\picture.jpg (B). This

dynamicity of path made it more useful to be used in local or web applications.

Relative File Path Delimiters:
While we use relative file paths, there are three delimiters(./, ../, and /)that are very important to

understand. For example. consider we are working in the index.html file located at the main
folder of D: drive, we can explain the use of relative file-path delimiters with the following

example:
1. The delimiter./ points to the parent folder of the current working file (index.html). For

Example: "./picture.jpg". Here, "picture.jpg" (A) file is located in the same folder (main

folder) as the current file (index.html)
2. The delimiter../ points to one folder up the parent folder of the current working file

(index.html). For example: "../picture.jpg". Here, the picture.jpg (B) file is pointed to the

location D:\picture.jpg
3. The delimiter / points to the root folder of the web project at all times. For

Example:"/picture.jpg". Here, "picture.jpg" (8) file is located at the root folder (D:\)
Absolute and relative URLs both are used to structure our site and link to its resources. There are
advantages and disadvantages to each. While absolute URLs provide better security and
improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization), relative URLs are quicker and easier to use
when developing websites.

4.2 WORKING WITH IMAGES

Images are the most common part of a great web site. Images make the web pages attractive. They
can also be used as buttons on the web pages. To use images in the HTML documents, we should
know some basics of images.

Many types of image formats are available to use in the web pages. In general, web-based images
come in two basic formats: GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) and JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group). File extension of GIF image format is .gif and JPEG image has

kx< at &= & &  ~—=3—sté‘<—s—s<~;C;3XPUCté~«S

Page_Number 72 ended
/n
Page_Number 73 started
extension .jpg or .jpeg. A third format, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is becoming popular
for web pages, Its file extension is .png. Itis supported in all the modern browsers.

Choosing the correct image is an important part of web design. In general, GIF images are good
for illustrations such as logos or cartoons, whereas JPEG images are used for complex images
such as photographs. While using these images in web pages, their size should be small so that the
web pages do not take long time to load. Let's see how to add images ona webpage.

To add an image to HTML page, we use <img> tag in the HTML document. The <img> tag is an
empty tag, which means it has no closing tag. It can contain only a list of attributes. Following is
the basic syntax to add an image to a web page:

<imgsrc="image_url">

Here, src is an essential attribute of <img> tag which stands for source. Every image tag has a sre
attribute which tells the browser where to find the image that we want to display, The “image_url”
points to the location where the image is stored, We can specify the image_url either using
absolute or relative file-path location. Following HTML program shows how to use an image in
the web page using the basic syntax of the <img> tag:
<html>
<head>
<title>Image Example</citle>
</head>
<body>
<hl>Welcome to School Education</h1>
<img src=", /education.jpg">
</body>
</html>

Program: 4.1 HTML Program (test! html) is Example for Using Images in Web Pages

Here, our HTML program - test].html and the image file - education.jpg, both are stored on
the same location (i.e, in D;\main folder).

4.2.1 Working with Attributes of <IMG> tag:

The sre attribute of <img> tag is essential for defining the image path. Though, some other
attributes of <img> tag are also available that helps us to work with images in the HTML
documents. Now, let's begin with what these attributes are and how to use them in <img> tag of
HTML document:

Setting Alternate Text for the Image:

The a/f attribute provides the alternate text for the image. If the user, for some reason, cannot view
the image (because of'slow connection or due to any mistake in the image urlofsre attribute) then
this alternate text will be displayed. The value of the alt attribute should describe the image. For
Example:

<html>

<head>
<title>Image Example</title>

</head>
<body>
<hl>Welcome to School Education</hi>
<img src="./edu.jpg" 2lt="Educational Image">
</body>

In this program, we mentioned the file name as edu.jpg in the sre attribute, while the actual name
of the file is education.jpg. Therefore, web browser will not be able to search the file named
“edu.jpg” at the current location. So, this program will not show the image, instead it will show
image error along with the alternate text mentioned in the alt attribute in <img> tag, as shown in
the figure 4.4:

Fig: 4.4 Output of Program 4.2 in Internet Explorer
Setting Width and Height of the Image:
The width and freight attributes are used to specify the width and height of an image. The values of
these attributes are interpreted in pixels by default. We can specify width and height of the image
in terms of percentage of its actual size.
<imgsre="education. jpg "alt="Educational Image" width="500" height="600" >

Setting Image Border:

By default, image will have no border around it. Border attribute can be used to set the border of
the image. We can specify border thickness in terms of pixels using border attribute. A thickness
of 0 means, no border around the picture. The default value of <img> border attribute is 0.
<imgsre="education. jpg "alt="Educational Image" width="500height="600"border="5" >

Setting Image Alignment:

The align attribute of <img> tag is used to set the alignment of an image in HTML documents. It
is used to specify the alignment of the image according to surrounding elements. By default,
image will align from the bottom side. Following are the possible values of align attribute for the

<img> tag:

* — left: It sets the alignment of image to the left,

* right: It sets the alignment of image to the right.

₹ middle: It sets the alignment of image to the middle.
¢ top: It sets the alignment of image to the top.

¢ bottom: It sets the alignment of image to the bottom.

4.3 WORKING WITH HYPERLINKS

HTML links are called Hyperlinks. It is an important property of HTML. A webpage can contain
various links. When we move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
Hyperlinks allow visitors to navigate between Web sites by clicking on words, phrases, and
images. By default, web browser shows links in blue color with underline. When we click on the
link, it takes us directly to other pages and even specific parts of a given page.

In HTML documents, a link is specified using <a> tag. This tag is called anchor tag. It is a paired
tag. Anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes part of the link. In

the opening tag of anchor tag, HREF attribute is used to specify the linked document, resource, or
location, Here, HREF stands for Hypertext Reference. This attribute can be used to link to local
files or files on the internet. Following is the simple syntax to use <a> tag.

<a href=“link_url">Link Text or Image</a>
Here, link_url is the address of linked document, resource or location, We can use absolute or
relative urls to mention the link_url for the HREF attribute. When user clicks on this “Link Text or
Image”, the web browser will take the user to the linked document, resource or location,

Fig: 4.6 Concept of Hyperlink

A hyperlink on the web page can have various states. Following are the common states of a link

and their default appearance in web browsers:
e Unvisited Links: These are the links that has not yet been clicked by the user. An

unvisited link is underlined and shown in blue color by default,
* Visited Links: These links are the links that user has previously clicked. A visited link is

underlined and shown in purple color by default.
* Active Links: This state refers to a link in the momenta user clicks on it.An active link is

underlined and shown in the red color by default,

Following HTML program shows how to create Hyperlinks:

In the Program 4.4, we have created three links. First two links are linked with the website of
google and Punjab school education board while third link is connected with local test] .html file
that we have created for image examples in this chapter. If we click on any one of the first two
links, then web browser will open the respective website while clicking on the third link will open
the web page of our Image Example. Linked document will open in the same web browser
window.

In the output of test2.html, first two links represent unvisited links (underlined in blue color)
while the third link represents the visited state of the link (underlined in purple color), 1.੯. we have
already visited/opened this link. If we click on any of the first two unvisited links, and reopen the
test2.html, then color of visited links also turns into purple color with underline.

4.3.1 Attributes of Anchor Tag:

The HREF attribute is the essential attribute of anchor tag which is used to specify the address of
the linked document or resource. Anchor tag is of no use without the HREF attribute. Besides
HREF tag, there are some other attributes too that can be used in the anchor tag which are
explained below:

Setting Titles for Links:

The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most

often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. For Example:
<a href="htps://google.com"title="Go to Google" >Google</a>
Setting Target Window:
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. We can also open the
linked document in the new tab-window. The target attribute is used to specify where to open the

linked document. The common values for target attribute can be one of the following:
* _self:It is the default value of target attribute. It opens the document in the same
window/tab as it was clicked.
¢ _blank:It opens the document in a new window or tab of web browser. For Example:
<a href="htps://google.com"title="Go to Google"target=""_blank" >Google</a>

4.3.2 Linking with Images:
We can also make hyperlinks with the images in web pages. For this, we put an image tag in
between the <a> and </a> tags, For example:

<a href="url" >

<imgsrc="“url_of _image’>

</a>
Now, when we click on the image-link, it will display the linked resource that we mentioned as a
url for hrefattribute. We can also make hyperlink with thumbnail images to present larger images.
A thumbnail is an image with a reduced file size that is used as a placeholder for full sized image.

<a href="larger_image"><imgsrce="thumbnail"></a>
When user clicks on the thumbnail image, it will show the larger image of the thumbnail image to
the user. Following HTML program shows how to create hyperlinks with the image:

4.3.3Link to an Email Address:

HTML <a> tag provides us option to specify an email address to send an email with a predefined
recipient address. While using <a> tag as an email tag, we will use mailto:email_address along
with href attribute, When the user clicks on the mailto: link, the default email-client opens on the
user's computer to send an email. An email client is a program or web application that is designed
to receive, write, send, and keep our email messages. Following is the syntax of using mailto:
instead of using http.

<a href= "mailto: abe@example.com">Send Email</a>
Now, if a user clicks this link, it launches one Email Client (like Lotus Notes, Outlook Express,

Thunderbird etc.) installed on user's computer to send email to the predefined recipient
abc@example.com. If user do not have email client installed on their computer then it would not

be possible to send email.
4.3.4Named Anchors or Creating Bookmarks:
A named anchor is a label assigned to part of an html document. Anchor tag enables users to

“jump” to this labelled part on a page, This is especially useful with large pages having many
sections/subdivisions. Named anchors are also called Bookmarks. There are two steps for using
bookmarks in HTML documents:

Step1: Create Named-Anchor:

For using bookmarks, first step is to create a named anchor in the HTML document. We can create
a named anchor by using the name attribute of <a> tag. Consider the following example which
creates a label assigned to a section named anchor - Section]

<a name="Sectionl">Title of the Section</a>
Step2: Create Link to 3 Named-Anchor:
After creating named anchor, next step is to create a link to the named anchor. For creating such

link to named anchor, we have to use /ref property of anchor tag and assign it the name of anchor
(that we have created in step1) with # symbol. If we want to create link for named anchors that are
available within the same document, the <a> element should be as follows:

<a href="#Sectionl"> Link Text for Sectionl</a>

Following HTML program shows how to implement the concept of bookmarks for a single
web page:

The Program 4.7 produces a very long web page. Only partial web page is shown in the above
output. In the program, we have created 4 Bookmark links to named-anchors at the top of the
page. When we click on any of the Bookmark Links (Computer System, Input Devices, Output
Devices, or Storage Devices), the web browser directly navigates to the respective labelled
part(named anchor) by scrolling automatically on the web page.

4.4 WORKING WITH FORMS

HTML Forms provide interactivity between user and website. These forms are like the simple
forms. They are used to get data from the user,such as - registration information: name, email
address, credit card, etc.A form will take input from the user. Then it will be posted/submitted to
web-server.At web-server, server-side scripts (ASP or PHP etc.) process the form's data and
stores it in the database. Following figure shows a sample HTML form with data filled by the user.
After filling data, user clicks on the “Submit Data” button to submit the filled data to the web
server. On the web server, a program, called server-side script, will get the filled data in the Form
to process it or to store it in the database.

different types of information from the user. Form elements can be a text field, text-area, drop-
down list, radio button, checkbox, etc. Following discussion explains the different types of form
elements and how to use them in the HTML document:

4.4.1 <FORM>Tag:

<FORM? tag is used to create a form in HTML document.<Form> is a paired tag. All the form
elements/controls to accept data from user are placed inside the <Form> and </From> tags. A
simple syntax of using <form> is as follows:

<formaction="script-file"method="posting method">

</form>
Here, action and method are the two most important attributes of form tag:
+ Action attribute: [tis used to specify the URL of the script which will receive form's data on
the web server.

« Method attribute: It is used to specify HTTP method for sending form-data to web server,
There are two kinds of HTTP methods, which are GET and POST:

» GET: In this method, Form values will be visible in the address bar of the web browser
after submitting the form-data. This method is not useful for sending sensitive/secure
information (such as passwords etc.) to web server, It is also very useful in those
situations where a user wants to bookmark the result.

POST: In this method, Form values will not be visible in the address bar of the web
browser after submitting the form-data, It appends form data inside the body of the
HTTP request. This method is essential when we want to store form-data to a database,
or when submitting sensitive information, such as passwords etc, Form submission with
POST cannot be book marked.

4.4.2 Elements or Controls for the HTML Form:

A Form contains many types of controls to accept the data from user. All these controls are put in
between the <form> and </form> tags. Following are the commonly used controls of web-forms:

੪ TextboxControl

« TextArea Control

* Password Field Control | — ene

¢« Button Control < ਕੇਸਰੋਰੋਸ਼ ਰੋਮ:
+ Submit Button 30039009800090

+ Reset Button Elements/Controls of HTML Form

These controls that are used commonly in web forms are explained here with suitable
examples:

4.4.2.1 Textboxor Text-Field Control:

This form control is used to accept a single line of text from the user. For example:user name,
search boxes etc. To create this control, we use <input> tag with ype=“fext” attribute. Consider
the following basic example of textbox control to accept single line of text:
<input type="text">
It will create a rectangular box where Users can input the text data. There are several optional
attributes that can be used with the <input> tag, which are given below:
* name: It is used to set the name of the control. This attribute is required for the server-side
scripting such as JSP, ASP, PHP etc. to get the data filled in the textbox.
« value: Itis used to provide the default value for the textbox control.
₹ size: Itis used to specify the width of the textbox in terms of characters.
੪ maxlength: itis used to specify the maximum number of characters a user can enter into the
text box.
Consider the following example with additional attributes for accepting user name:
User Name:<input type="text" size="20" maxlength="50">
This code creates a textbox to accept maximum 50-characters long text in 8 single line. It will be
shown 20 characters wide on the web page, as shown below. User can fill text-data in this text-
field,

4.4.2.2 Password FieldControl:
1118 also a Single-line text input control but it masks the input character as soon as a user enters it.
Therefore, this control is used to accepts the password type secure information in the web pages.
To create this control, we use <input> tag with #pe=“password” attribute. Consider the
following basic example of password control:

Input Password: <input type="password">
This code creates a text-ficld to accept password information. It masks the input character as soon
as a user enters any text in it.

This Control also supports name. size. maxlength. and value as optional attributes.
4.4.2.3 Text AreaControl:
This control is used to accept multiple lines of text from the user. Typically, this control is used to
accept the address information, comments, feedback etc, from the user. To create this control,
<textarea> element is used in the HTML documents. There are two important attributes of
<textarea> control:

* rows: Itis used to set the height (number of rows) of textarea control,

+ cols: Itis used to set the width of text area control in terms of characters.
<textarea> element is a paired tag. So, it must be closed with </textarea> closing tag. Consider the
following basic example of text area control:

Address Information: <br>

<textarearows="5" cols="50"></textarea>
This code creates a text-area having 5 rows and 50 columns (in terms of characters) to accept

address information from user.

4.4.2.4 Checkbox Control:

Check boxes allows a user to select zero or more options from a limited set of choices. It is a very
convenient way of accepting data when the possible inputs are already known. To create this
control, we use <input> tag with type=“checkbox” attribute. Consider the following basic
example of checkbox control to accept user choice:

Select Your Subjects: <br>

<input type="checkbox" name="cl" value="Chemistry">Chemistry

<br>

<input type="checkbox" name="cl" value="Physics"> Physics<br>

<input type="checkbox" name="cl" value="Math">Math
This code creates three check boxes for selecting subjects from user. User can select zero or more
subjects from the given choices. Here, the same attribute is required for the server-side scripting
such as JSP, ASP. PHP etc. to get the values (mentioned in the va/ve attribute) of selected check
boxes. Check boxes can have the same name to forma group:

Fig:4.17 Example of Checkbox Control
4.4.2.5 Radio Button Control:
Radio buttons are used in those situations where we want to accepts as a Boolean value or we
expect only one input as true out of multiple options. In simple terms, we can say that Radio
Buttons are used for a single selection from a given group of options. Some common uses of radio
buttons are gender determination, employee type (Regular/Temporary), etc. To create this

control, we use <input> tag with ¢ype=“radio” attribute. Consider the following basic example
of radio button control:

Select Gender:<br>

<input type="radio" name="gender" value="Male">Male <br>

<input type="radio" name="gender" value="Female">Female
This code creates two radio buttons for selecting gender value from the user. User can select only
one of the given choices. Here, the name attribute is required for the server-side scripting such as
JSP, ASP, PHP etc. to get the values (mentioned in the va/ve attribute) of selected radio button.
Radio buttons can have the same name to form a group:

4.4.2.6 Selection List Control:

Selection List control is also known as Drop Down List. This control is used to select one or more
options from the huge list of options. The <select> tag is used to create Drop-Down box. The
options to be selected is listed with <option> tag having va/we as the attribute. The value of
selected option will be sent to the web-server after form submission. The HTML code given
below shows the use of <select> tag with <option> tag to create a Selection Box or Dropdown
control:

Select a Language: <br>
<select name="language">
<option value="Hindi">Hindi</option>
<option value="Punjabi">Punjabi</option>
<option value="English">English</option>
<option value="Urdu">Urdu</option>
</select>
This code will create a dropdown control to select a language from the given four options, By
default, it will display the first option from the list. By clicking on the dropdown arrow, we can
view the list of other available options. To select any option, just click on the option from the
dropdown list.

4.4.2.7 File Upload Control:
If we want to allow a user to upload a file to our web site from his/her computer, we will need to
use a file upload box, also known as a file select box, To create this control, we use <input> tag
with #ype="file” attribute. Consider the following basic example of file upload control:

<input type="file" name="fileupload" accept="image/*">
Here, name attribute is required for the server-side scripting such as JSP, ASP, PHP etc. to get the
uploaded file and the accep? attribute is used to specify the types of files that the server accepts.
The accept="image/*” specifies that server will accept only image type files:

4.4.2.8 Creating Buttons:
Different types of buttons can be created for different tasks in HTML. We can create clickable
buttons using <input> tag by setting the spe attribute. The type attribute can take the following
values to create different types of buttons in the HTML documents:
+ submit: [t is used to create a submit button. When this button is clicked, the browser will
automatically send all the form-data to the web server.
* reset: It is used to create a reset button. When this button is clicked, the browser will
automatically reset all form-controls to their initial values.
+ button: It is used to create a button that is used to call/run a function/code written in
client-side scripting languages (such as: JavaScript).
+ Image: Itis used to create a clickable button with image background.
Consider the following basic example for creating commonly used buttons on forms:
<input type="submit" value="Submit Data">
<input type="reset" value="Reset Form">

Fig:4.22 Example of Button Controls (Submit & Reset Buttons)

Here, we create two buttons- one for submitting form data and other for resetting form values.
When we click on the submit button, it will send form's data to web server and if we click on reset
button, it will clear all filled values in the form and reset the form controls to their initial values.
Now, we will create a complete basic example program for just creating form and various
form-controls:

4.5 PHASES OF WEB DEVELOPMENT

Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such
as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. Ina broader sense,
web development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to build,
maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are optimal.
Web development is also known as website development, while the professionals that maintain a
website are called web developers (also known as Web Devs). Most web developers use
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Client-Side Scripting
Language such as JavaScript and Server-Side Scripting Language, such as PHP, ASP etc. to
develop websites. Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too —
making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as
you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.Good knowledge in this field
can shape your career.

The web development process requires a team of experts responsible for implementing the

Fig: 4.25 Various Phases for Website Development
Phase 1: Information Gathering

This is the most important phase of website development. It involves understanding the client's

requirements, identify their needs and helps them in providing the perfect solution. Following are
some of the very important points that should be considered in this phase:

¢ What is the purpose of creating a website?

₹ Whatis the main goal of the building a website?

e Which target audience we want to get targeted?

9 Which type of contents our target audience will look for?
Every website is different from the other, so gathering relevant information regarding the project
is very important. So. it is vital to get insights so that an appealing website is created.
Phase 2: Planning
Good website is the result of good planning. Planning is nothing but prioritizing tasks for website
completion. All the planning process should have the involvement of the client. So, the client has
an idea about the blueprint of the project. The important task to be performed in this phase are
given below:

9 Develop the sitemap of the website.

e Think of the best user interface that can be created for easy navigation.

9 Decide the menus, contents & navigational system for the website.

e Prepare a detailed list of all the areas of the website and the sub-topics

Phase 3: Design& Layout
This is the creative phase of website design. In this phase, look and feel of the website is
determined. The designer needs to understand each & every aspect of the client expectation & try
to sketch it. The designer gives life to the graphics, typography, colors, animations, buttons, drop-
down and pop-up menus, and more as per the project requirement. From logo design to selecting
templates, everything is discovered in this phase.
Phase 4: Development
After designing, there is a development phase. The development phase is also a very crucial phase
for the website design. This is the phase where actual website starts its implementation. All the
elements are used to generate a functional website. The development process begins with first
developing the home page followed by the interior pages. Here, we integrate all the information
that we had collected from initial phases. Creating Database, logic & actual programming is done
here. At this stage, web developers develop/build websites using a variety of programming
languages, such as - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
Client-Side Scripting Languages (for example: JavaScript) and Server-Side Scripting Languages
(for example: PHP, ASP, etc.).
Phase 5: Testing & Launch
After the completion of web development, the functionality of the website is tested along with the
device compatibility. The tester validates the codes written for the website. The following are the
types of website testing:

₹ Content Testing

₹ Functional Testing

¢ Design Testing
All these types of testing are done offline. After offline testing of the website, we upload the files to
the server. Now again we test it, but this test is performed online, In this testing we should check
whether all the files are uploaded properly or not and also assures that the website is working
properly, After Testing is finalized, the site is launched for public view,
Phase 6: Maintenance
The last phase of website development is Maintenance. In this stage, some elements are changed
as per the user's feedback, support, and maintenance. Maintenance means updating the contents
& design of the website. Website maintenance is an on-going process. One good way to attract
potential visitors and repeat their visits is 10 keep updating the content and adding new contents on
a regular basis.

Any internet location available on server is called a web URL ora web address.
Anabsolute URL gives complete location to a resource (file).
A Relative URL describes the path of the file relative to the location of the current web

page file.

To add an image to HTML page, we use <imgsrc=“image_url"> tag in the HTML
document

Hyperlinks allow visitors to navigate between Web sites by clicking on words, phrases,
and images.

In HTML documents, a link is specified using <ahref=“link_url”> tag. This tag is called
anchor tag.

Anamed anchor is a label assigned to part ofan html document. Named anchors are also
called Bookmarks.

HTML Forms provide interactivity between user and website.

Method attribute of form is used to specify HTTP method for sending form-data to web
server. There are two kinds of HTTP methods, which are GET and POST

. While using GET HTTP method, Form values will be visible in the address bar of the web
browserafter submitting the form-data.

. Textarea control is used to accept multiple lines of text from the user.
. Checkboxes allows a user to select zero or more options from a limited set of choices.

. Radio Buttons are used fora single selection froma given group of options.

. Selection Box control is also known as Drop Down Box which is used to select one or
more options from the huge list of options.

. Submit button is used to automatically submits form-data to web server

. Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites.

. Planning is nothing but prioritizing tasks for website completion.

. The development process begins with first developing the home page followed by the
interior pages.

. After the completion of web development, the functionality of the website is tested along
with the device compatibility.

. Maintenance means updating the contents & design of the website.

OPERATING SYSTEM

5.2 Types of Operating Systems
5.3 Single-User and Multi-User Operating Systems

5.4 Computer Security

INTRODUCTION:

Operating system is a System Software. It is used to operate or run computer. It also helps the
user to interact with the parts of the computer, i.e., the hardware. It provides an environment in
which the users can work efficiently on the computer system. An operating system is a software
which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process
management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives
and printers. Operating system is needed to manage computer resources efficiently, Some
popular Operating Systems include Windows, DOS, Unix, Linux, Mac OS etc.

§,1 OPERATING SYSTEM

An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the computer
hardware, and controls the execution ofall kinds of programs, as shown below in the figure 5.1

5.1. 1Services provided by operating System
Operating system provides certain services to programs and to the users. It provides an
environment for the execution of programs. It provides users the services to execute the programs
in a convenient manner, These services also provide convenience to the programmer. The basic
services or functions provided by the operating system are as follows:

e User Interface

e Program execution

# WOoperations

* File System manipulation

« Communication

« Error Detection

* Resource Allocation

« Protection

5.1.1.1 User interface:
Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI). This interface is used to interact with the
computer system. This interface can be Batch Interface, or CUI (Character User Interface) or GUI
(Graphics User Interface):
e In Batch Interface commands and directives are entered into files, and then these files are
executed. Batch Operating System is best example of such user interface.
₹ CULuses text commands to perform any operation. DOS is the best example for such type
of user interface.
₹ GULis the most common user interface. It provides a graphical way to interact with the
computer system. Windows is the best example of such user interface.

5.1.1.2 Program execution
Operating systems handle many kinds of activities from user programs to system programs like
prints pooler, name servers, file server, etc. Each of these activities is encapsulated as a process. A
process is a program in execution and includes the complete execution context (code to execute,
data to manipulate, registers, OS resources in use), Following are the major activities of an
operating system with respect to program management —

¢ Loadsa program into memory,

« Executes the program.

e Handles program's execution.

« Provides a mechanism for process synchronization.

₹ Provides a mechanism for process communication,

¢ Provides a mechanism for deadlock handling,

.
§.1,1,3 1/O Operation:
Arunning program may require I/O, which may involves a file or an I/O device. Users usually
cannot control I/O devices directly. Therefore, the operating system must provide a means to do
1/O, An I/O subsystem comprises of [/O devices and their corresponding driver software, Drivers
hide the internal functioning of specific hardware devices from the users. An Operating System
manages the communication between user and device drivers.

« V/Ooperation means read or write operation with any file or any specific I/O device.

« Operating system provides the access to the required I/O device when required.

§.1.1.4 File System Manipulation:
As we know a file represents a collection of related information. Computers can store files on the
disk (secondary storage). File manipulation refers to a wide variety of operations. Create, delete,
copy, move, search are the common operations that can be performed on the files and folders. A
file system is normally organized into directories for easy navigation and usage. These
directories may contain files and other directories. Following are the major activities of an
operating system with respect to file management —

e Program needs to read a file or write a file.

* The operating system gives the permission to the program for performing operations on

files.

« Permission varies from read-only, read-write, denied and so on.

* Operating System provides an interface to the user to create/delete files.

« Operating System provides an interface to the user to create/delete directories.

5.1.1.5 Communication:
Sometimes one process needs to exchange information with another process. Such
communication may occur between processes on the same computer or on different computer
systems using a network. This communication may be implemented via shared memory or
through message passing. All such communications between processes are performed with the
help of operating system.
In case of distributed systems, which are a collection of processors that do not share memory,
peripheral devices, or a clock, the operating system manages communications between
processes in a network. Multiple processes communicate with one another through
communication lines in the network.
Following are the major activities ofan operating system with respect to communication:

« Twoprocesses often require data to be transferred between them

¢ Both the processes can be on one computer or on different computers, but are connected

through a computer network.

5.1.1.6 Error Detection:
Errors can occur anytime and anywhere. Errors may occur in the CPU and memory hardware
(e.g. due to power failure), in I/O devices (e.g. lack of paper in the printer), and in the user
program (e.g. an arithmetic overflow). For each type of error, the operating system should take
the appropriate action, Following are the major activities of an operating system with respect to
error Detection:

₹ TheOS constantly checks for possible errors.

e The OS takes an appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing.

5.1.1.7 Resource Management:
When there are multiple users or multiple jobs running at the same time, resources, such as main
memory, CPU cycles and files storage, must be allocated to each of them. Many different types of
resources (CPU, Memory etc.) are managed by the operating system, So, operating system should
allocate the resources to multiple jobs in an efficient way. Following are the major activities of an
operating system with respect to resource management —

e Itacts asa resource manager.

₹ Operating System manages all kinds of resources using schedulers.

₹ CPUscheduling algorithms are used for better utilization of CPU.

§.1.1.8 Protection:
Protection refers to a mechanism or a way to control the access of programs, processes, or users
to the resources defined by a computer system. Considering a computer system having multiple
users and concurrent execution of multiple processes. In such a system, the various processes
must be protected from each other's activities. Following are the major activities of an operating
system with respect to protection:

¢ The OS ensures that any access to system resources is controlled.

₹ The OS ensures that external I/O devices are protected from invalid access attempts.

« The OS provides authentication features for each user by means of passwords.

5.2 TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS
In this topic, we will discuss some of the important types of operating systems, which are most
commonly used.

§.2.1 Batch Operating System:

The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly, Each user
prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator.
The operator sorts jobs into batches. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched
together. This batch is then entered into the system and the operating system executes these jobs
one by one. When the job is completed, its output is sent back to the appropriate user.

Fig:5.2 Batch Processing System

In batch system, major task of operating system is to transfer control automatically from one job
to the next. In this system, output is usually printed on a line printer. The problems with Batch
Systems are as follows:

¢ Lack of interaction between the user and the job,

« CPUisoften idle, because the speed of the mechanical I/O devices is slower than the CPU.

₹ Difficult to provide the desired priority.
In this execution environment, the CPU is often idle during the I/O operations. It is because speed
of L/O devices is slower than CPU. Even a slow CPU can work in this system. The introduction of
disk technology has helped in this regard. Cards are read directly from card reader and stored on
the disk. When a job is executed, operating system provides the input from the disk, which was
stored from punch cards. Similarly, when the job requests the printer, the output is written into the
disk. When the job is completed, output is actually printed. This form of processing is called
Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operation Online)

Fig: 5.3 Spooling in Batch Processing System

ਛਲ OPERATING SYSTEM |

Page_Number 101 ended
/n
Page_Number 102 started
Thus, spooling technique overcome the problems in simple batch processing: because the speed
of disk is faster than the input/output devices. In spooling after completion of execution of one
program, CPU has notto wait for the slow speed input device to feed next job.

§,2.2 Multi-Programming Operating System:

Multiprogramming refers to keeping several programs in different parts of the main memory at
the same time and executing them concurrently, The CPU switches from one program to another
program instantaneously. Since the speed of CPU is much faster than that of 1/O operations. When
one program is busy with I/O operations, CPU's time is allocated to another program instead of
remaining idle. Hence, in multiprogramming system, when one program is waiting for 1/6)
transfer, there is another program ready to use the CPU. A simple example of multiprogramming
is given in the following figure:

Main Memory

Secondary Storage
Fig:5.4 Multi-Programming System

In the fig:5.4, After using CPU, Program A is busy in writing its output on the secondary storage,
while at the same time, program B is utilizing the CPU, and program C is waiting for CPU to
become free. Thus, in multi-programming system, CPU switches from one program to another
program that resides in the main memory. In this system, the idle time of CPU is less than the non-
multiprogramming systems. Multiprogramming systems also provide the facility for setting
priorities for the programs residing in main memory.

5.2.3 Time-Sharing Operating Systems:

The principal method of a time-sharing system is to provide direct access to the computer to a
large number of users. This is accomplished by providing a separate terminal to each user. A
terminal is an access point to a remote machine which usually consists of I/O Devices without
having its own CPU. All these terminals are connected to the main computer system. Thus, a
time-sharing system has many terminals linked to the same computer at the same time.

Each user has at least one separate program in memory. A time-sharing operating system uses

CPU scheduling and multiprogramming techniques. A little time of CPU is given to each user's
program in this system in a circular way, This little CPU time given to each user is known as Time,
Slice or Time Quantum, which ranges between 10 to 20 milliseconds.

users.
Advantages of Time-Sharing System: |
1. Reduces CPU idle time.
2. Reduces the output of paper.
3. Avoids duplication of software.
4. Quick Response, i.e. turnaround & response time is negligible.
Disadvantages of Time-Sharing System:
1. Large main memory is required for user programs.
2. Itrequires CPU scheduling techniques. ।
3. Memory management is required.
4. Question of security and Integrity of user programs and data. |

5.2.4 Multi-Processing Operating System:

Multiprocessing system is used to describe interconnected computers, with two or more CPUs.
These systems have the ability to simultaneously execute several programs. In such a system!
instructions from different and independent programs can be processed simultaneously by
different CPUs, or the CPUs may simultaneously execute different instructions from the same
program. The basic organization ofa typical multiprocessing system is shown below:

Multiprocessing system are of two types-Tightly Coupled Systems and Loosely Coupled
Systems. In tightly coupled systems, there is a single primary memory, which is shared by all the
processors, On the other hand, in loosely coupled systems, each processor has its own local
memory. Tightly coupled systems are known as Parallel Processing Operating Systemswhile
loosely coupled operating systems are known as Distributed Operating Systems.
Advantages of Multiprocessing:
|. It improves the performance of computer systems by allowing parallel processing of
programs.
2. It provides a built-in backup. If one CPU breaks down, the other CPU automatically takes
over the complete workload until repairs are made.
Disadvantages of Multiprocessing:
1. Alarge main memory is required.
2. Avery sophisticated operating system is required to schedule balance.
3. Such systems are very expensive.

§.2.5Network Operating System:
A Network Operating System runs 011 server. This Operating System provides the capability to
manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The primary
purpose of the network operating system is to allow file sharing and printer access among
multiple computers in a network. Examples of network operating systems are: Microsoft
Windows Server 2003, Microsofi Windows Server 2008. UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell
NetWare etc,
Advantages of Network Operating Systems:

₹ Centralized servers are highly stable

e Security is managed by server

e Remote access to servers is possible from different locations and types of systems.
Disadvantages of Network Operating Systems:

₹ Highcostofbuying and running a server.

e Dependency ona central location(server) for most operations.

e Regular maintenance and updates are required.
§.2.6 Real Time Operating System:
A real-time system is defined as a data processing system in which the time interval required to
process and respond to inputs is so small. The time taken by the system to respond to an input and
display of required updated information is termed as the response time. So, in this method, the
response time is very less as compared to online processing.
Real-time systems are used when there are rigid time requirements on the operation of a

processor or the flow of data. A real-time operating system must have well-defined, fixed time
constraints, otherwise the system will fail. Real-time operating systems are used to control
machinery, scientific instruments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon
systems, robots, air traffic control systems ete,

§.3 SINGLE USERAND MULTIUSER OPERATING SYSTEMS

A Single-User Operating System is a system in which only one user can access the computer
system ata time. In other words, it supports one user at a time. However, it may support more than
one user-profiles. Single keyboard and single monitor are used for the purpose of interaction. The
most common example of a single user operating system is a system that is found in a typical
home computer. Examples of Single User Operating Systems are - MS DOS, Windows 95,
Windows NT, Windows 2000, etc.

On the other hand, A Multi-User Operating System is a system that allows more than one user to
access a computer system at one time. Generally, a network is laid down, so that a computer can be
remotely used. Mainframes and minicomputers work on multi-user operating systems. These
operating systems are complex in comparison to single user operating systems, Each user is
provided with a terminal and all these terminals are connected to the main computer. Examples of
Multi User Operating Systems are Mainframes such as IBM AS400, Linux & Unix Distributed

5.4 COMPUTER SECURITY

Computer Security is also known as Cyber Security or IT Security. It is the protection of
computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. So, if we have a
computer, the main objective of computer security is to protect the system's information from any

external or internal harms.
Under computer security, we have various types of attacks like malware attack, denial of

service, man in the middle, phishing, and so on. There can be multiple motives for these attacks,
such as information theft, disrupting business, demanding ransom, etc,
Computer security is mainly concerned with three main areas, also known as CIA triads:

¢ Confidentiality ensures that data exchanged is not accessible to unauthorized users.
¢ Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized changes to ensure that it is reliable

and correct.
੦ Availability means authorized users have access to the systems and the resources they

need.

In simple language, computer security is making sure information and computer components are
usable but still protected from people or software that shouldn't access it or modify it.

§.4.1 Computer Security Threats:

A computer security threat refers to any possible malicious attack. These threats can affect the
smooth functioning of our PC. In the present age, computer security threats are constantly
increasing as the world is going digital. The most harmful types of computer security threats are

Page_Number 107 started
mentioned below:

. Malware: Malware is malicious software such as viruses, spyware, worms, ransomware
and trojan horses etc. Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or
attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Computer Viruses replicate
itself and infects the files and programs of our PC and can make them non-functional.
Spyware collects sensitive information like user id, passwords, credit card information
stored in the computer system etc, from a computer system without user's consent. Worms
are malicious programs that make copies of itself to use up our computer hard-disk space.

° Phishing: Phishing is a technique used by cyber criminals to steal
login credentials & financial information of users. Phishing in
unfortunately very easy to execute. Attackers may target victim via
phishing emails, These mails show fake offers to lure users &
encourage them to submit their financial & personal information,
which can be misused by the attacker.

° Rootkit: A Rootkit is defined as a malicious computer software hidden

deep inside a PC and remains undetectable. Attackers can have ‘root or

administrative’ access to the user's computer using rootkit softwares.
Hence, it is considered extremely dangerous for user's privacy and PC 4 * ਰੈ
users need an anti-rootkit software.
° Keylogger; Also known as a keystroke logger, keyloggers can track the
real-time activity of a user on his computer. Keylogger runs in the
background and records all keystrokes made by a user and passes the

information to the hacker. It is also a very powerful threat to steal
people's login credential such as username and password.

These are perhaps the most common security threats that we come across. Apart from these, there
are others like adware, botnet, scarewareand many more. Fortunately, there are ways to protect
ourselves against these attacks.

§.4.2 How Do We Secure Our Computer?

Computer security threats are becoming relentlessly inventive these days. Internet Security is the
most important aspect that everyone using the internet should understand, For best computer
security, we must follow certain guidelines, which are also called Computer Best Practices,

Following are some important tips that can help us to secure and protect our Information from
various Security threats:

e Latest Anti-Malware software: Anti-malware is a computer program used to prevent,
detect, and remove malware. An anti-malware software protects the computer from
malware such as viruses, spyware, adware, and worms ete. It scans the system for all
types of malicious software that manage to reach the computer. An anti-malware program
is one of the best tools to keep the computer and personal information protected. To make
Anti-malware software more effective, we need to update it with latest updates available.
Examples of anti-malware software include: Norton, Quickheal, Kaspersky, Bitdefender
and McAfee ete.

₹ Password protection: Passwords are the most important aspect of various online
accounts. They provide access to online accounts and enable us to perform various
activities linked with account like shopping, emailing, online transactions ete, Keeping
our password secure is like keeping money secure. Never keep same passwords for
different accounts. Never keep password's that can be guessed. Change passwords
regularly, using a unique combination of numbers, letters and case types.

₹ Apply Latest Updates & Patches: No software installed on our system is perfect for
life. Apply the latest updates & patches to the software. These updates and patches are
made available from time to time by the software manufacturer.

e Firewall: A firewall acts as a security guard between the internet and our local area
network. It prevents hackers from attacking our system. Firewall blocks unauthorized
access to our PC,

9 — Avoid clicking on email attachments unless we know the source.

₹ — Use the internet with caution and ignore pop-ups, drive-by downloads while surfing

e Create a periodic system backup schedule to ensure your data is retrievable should
something happen to your computer.

e — Perform daily full system scans with various types of anti-malwares

Apart from these, there are many other ways we can protect files and our computer system.
Aspects such as encryption and computer cleaners can assist in protecting our computers and its
files.

Desktop Publishing: In short DTP is the process of
using a computer and specialised software to integrate
and re-arrange text, images and artwork to produce
documents in any language those are properly
formatted for print or visual display. Desktop
Publishing can be used to create books, magazines,
newspapers, pamphlets and many other kinds of

printed documents.
Desktop Publishing involves the combination of

typesetting (choosing fonts and the text layout),
graphics design, page layout and printing the
document. For Desktop Publishing, all we need is a
computer system, printer and software that can create
a printable document.

Desktop Publishing began in 1985 with the
introduction of Aldus PageMaker software and the

6.4 WYSIWYG:

The WYSIWYG stands for “What You See fs What You Get”. In printing and computing, it is a
system that shows you exactly what the document will look like when you print it. In computers,
laptops, and tablets, the 'print preview’ feature isa WYSIWYG application. A WYSIWYG isa
feature in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its
appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web
page, or slide presentation.

AWYSIWYG editor or program Is one that allows a developer to see what the end result will look
like while the interface or document is being created. The first WYSIWYG editor was a word
processing program called Bravo that was invented by Charles Simonyi at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center in the 1970s, WYSIWYG is especially popular for desktop publishing. Before
printing something, looking at what it will look like is useful if you want to determine what parts
of the document need to be changed. It also helps you determine whether you need to add
anything.

6.5 GRAPHICS

A graphic is an image or visual representation of an object. Therefore, computer graphics are
simply images displayed on a computer screen. Graphics are often contrasted with text, which is
comprised of characters, such as numbers and letters, rather than images.

Computer graphics can be either two or three-dimensional.

6.5.1 2D Graphics:

Earlier computers supported only 2D monochrome graphics; those were supported by only black
and white color. Eventually, computers began to support color images. While the first machines
supported only 16 or 256 colors, most computers can now display graphics in millions of colors,
2D computer graphics is the computer-based generation of digital images of two dimensional. 2D
computer graphics started in the 1950s,

2D graphics are widely used in animation and videos. They provide a realistic, but flat, view of

movement on the screen. There are two main types of 2D graphics:
e — Raster or Bitmap graphics
e —-Vector graphics
6.5.1.1 Raster or Bitmap Graphics:
Raster graphics. also called bitmap graphics, is a type of digital -ਰਸਰਪਤਤ ਪਰਮਾਤਮਾ

arranged in a grid formation to represent an image. Bitmap

graphics consist of many tiny dots called pixels. It is possible to

edit each individual pixel by using bitmap graphics software like

Adobe Photoshop. The amount of detail we can draw depends on

the number of pixels per square inch (PSI). Since the computer

file size of a bitmap graphics is often quite large. When we resize a bitmap graphic, it tends to lose
its quality.

Digital Photographs or Scanned Images are examples of Raster or Bitmap Graphics. The file
formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP and MPEG4 are commonly used Raster Graphics images.
6.5.1.2 Vector Graphics:

points, which are connected by lines and curves to form polygons e

and other shapes. Vector graphics can be resized to any resolution 4
without losing the quality. The points determine the direction of

the vector path: each path may have various properties including eC
values for stroke color, shape, curve, thickness and fill. It is

shape, outline type (stroke), fill, size or position of each object

separately, Vector graphic displays were first used in 1958 by the US SAGE Air Defence System
Vector graphics are commonly found today in the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), PDF
(Portable Document Format), CDR (CorelDraw File extension) or Al types of graphic file
formats.

6.5.2 3D Graphics:

3D or Three-dimensional graphics provide realistic views by showing depth of objects that allows
the viewer to see objects into spaces. We can notice the movement of light and shadows in 3D
Graphics, This technique helps create 3D objects using shapes and colors, 3D graphics appears
more realistic as they are seen in the real-world (e.g., a building, a person, a car etc.),

3D graphics started to become popular in the 1990s, along with 3D rendering software such as
CAD and 3D animation programs. By the year 2000, many video games had begun incorporating
3D graphics, since computers had enough processing power to support them.

Fig:6,2 Use of 3D Modeling in Virtual Reality

3D modelling is used in Virtual Reality environments to produce realistic scenes, There are many
varieties of files supporting 3D graphics, for example, Wavefront .obj files and .x DirectX files.
Each file type generally tends to have its own unique data structure,

6.6 MARGINS
A margin is the space between the main content of a page and its edges. The margin helps to define
where a line of text begins and ends, Depending on the requirement, the margin size can be
adjusted. These margins create a frame around the content of the page so that the text does not run
all the way to the edges. The white space along the edges of the document makes the page look
cleaner and the text becomes easier to read. Following figure shows the different types of
margins:

Margins =

6.6.1 Gutter Margin

Gutter margin is the margin that is added to the binding side of the page when printing. It is an
additional margin added to a page layout for the binding purpose. A gutter margin ensures that
contents of text are not hidden while binding the book. Word processors, like MS Word, typically
allow you to choose whether to position the gutter margin of your document at the top or left of the
page.

6.7 FONTS

A font is a graphical representation of text that may include a different typeface, point size,
weight, color, or design. A typeface is a set of characters of the same design. These characters
include letters, numbers, punctuation marks and symbols. While most computers come with a
few dozen typefaces installed, there are thousands of typefaces available. The term "typeface" is
often confused with "font," rather it is a specific size and style of a typeface. Arial, Helvetica,
Cambria, Times New Roman, Anmolipi, Asees and Verdana are examples of fonts.

6.8 FRAMES & LAYERS

Frames are rectangular areas meant for inserting graphics and text. They allow users to place
objects wherever they want on the page. Because text and images are handled in DTP as separate
units, they are placed on the page as frames surrounded by bounding boxes. These frames can then
be changed in size or position using the bounding boxes. Frames allow for complete control of the
page design. Text frames can also be linked to allow text to flow from one column to another or
one page to another. Frames can be a rectangle, an oval, or a polygon. Polygon frames can be
changed to any shape. Frames can contain text, graphics or be empty.

Fig 6.5 Frames Fig: 6.6 Layers

In Graphics software, Layers are the different levels at which one can place an object or image
file. Layers can be stacked, merged or defined when creating a digital image. Layers can also be
used to combine two or more images into a single digital image. In some graphic applications,
such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP etc. we use layers to work on multiple objects in the image.

6.9 PRINTER
A printer is an external output device that is used to print documents which may include text
documents, images or a combination of both. A printer is a peripheral machine that takes data
from a computer and generates output on a paper in the form of graphics or text.
There are two types of printers:

e Impact Printers ( Daisy Wheel Printer, Dot Matrix Printer and Line printer)

੪ Non-Impact Printers (Inkjet Printer, Laser Printer)

6.9.1 Impact printers

These are those printers in which characters or graphics are printed by striking print-head on the
paper. Impact printers have mechanical moving parts to conduct printing. They work by creating
a direct contact between ink ribbon and paper. It usually forms the print image by striking its pins
onan inked ribbon against the paper. These printers are noisy and yet popular.

The various types of Impact Printers are as follows:

6.9.1.1 Dot-Matrix Printers:

A dot matrix printer (DMP) is a type of printer which uses pins impacting an ink ribbon to
print. These printers are generally considered out-dated, as they cannot create high-quality
prints. However, they have a certain specialty that other printers like inkjet and laser printers do
not have, as they use impact for printing, they can be used to print multiple copies of text at the
same time with the help of carbon copying. Therefore, they are mostly used in places where
multipart forms are required.

Fig: 6.7 Dot Matrix Printer (DMP) with sample output

The dot-matrix printer uses print heads containing from 9 to 24 pins, These pins produce patterns
of dots on the paper to form the individual characters. The 24 pin dot-matrix printer produces
more dots than a 9 pin dot-matrix printer, which results in much better quality and clear text, The
general rule is: more the pins, clear the characters on the paper. The pins strike the ribbon
individually as the print mechanism moves across the entire print line in both directions, i.e, from
left to right, then right to left and so on. Dot-matrix printers are inexpensive and typically print at
speeds of 100-600 characters per second.

A dot matrix printer is also known as an impact matrix printer.

6.9.1.2 Daisy-wheel Printers:

In order to get the quality of type found on typewriters, a daisy-wheel impact printer can be used.
The daisy-wheel printer appeared in 1972. It is called a daisy-wheel printer because the print
mechanism looks like a daisy; at the end of each “Petal” is a fully formed character which
produces a solid-line print. A hammer strikes a “petal” containing a character against the ribbon
and the character prints on the paper. Its speed is slow, typically 25-55 characters per second.

/n
Page_Number 121 started
6.9.1.3 Line Printers:

Line printers or line-at-a-time printers, use a special mechanism that can print a whole line at
once; it can typically print the range of 1,200 to 6,000 lines per minute. In business, where large
amount of material is printed, the character-at-a-time printers are too slow: therefore these users
need line-at-a-time printers to serve the purpose of the business firm. Drum Printer, Chain Printer,
and band printers are examples of line-at-a-time printers.

Fig: 6.9 Line Printer and its Printing Mechanism

6.9.2 Non-Impact Printers;

These are those printers in which characters or graphics are printed without striking print-head on
the paper. Non-impact printers use a cartridge filled with toner or liquid ink, which allows them to
produce fine-quality images quickly and quietly. The printer cartridges are casily recyclable,
resulting in environmental benefits as well. It is a type of printer that does not hit or impact a
ribbon to print. The various types of Non-Impact Printers are as follows:

6.9.2.1 Ink-jet printers

Ink-jet printers work in the same manner as dot-matrix
printers in the form of images or characters with little dots.
However, the dots are formed by tiny droplets of ink. Ink-
jet printers form characters on paper by spraying ink from
tiny nozzles through an electrical field that arranges the
charged ink particles into characters at the rate of
approximately 250 characters per second. The ink is
absorbed into the paper and dries instantly. Various colors
of ink can also be used, Fig: 6.10 Inkjet Printer

One or more nozzles in the print head emit a steady stream of ink drops. Droplets of ink are
electrically charged after leaving the nozzle. The droplets are then guided to the paper by
electrically charged deflecting plates [one plate has positive charge (upper plate) and the other has
negative charge (lower plate)]. A nozzle for black ink may be all that is needed to print text, but
full-color printing is also possible with an addition of the requirement to print text, three extra
nozzles for the cyan, magenta, and yellow primary colors. If a droplet isn't needed for the
character or image being formed, it is recycled back to its input nozzle. These printers produce
less noise and print in better quality with greater speed.

6.9.2.2 Laser printers:

A laser printer works like a photocopy machine. Laser
printers produce images on paper by directing a laser beam
at a mirror which again directs the beam onto a drum. The
drum has a special coating on it to which toner (an ink
powder) sticks, Using patterns of small dots, a laser beam
conveys information from the computer to a positively
charged drum to become neutralized. From all those areas
of drum which become neutralized, the toner detaches. As Fig 6.11; Laser Printer

the paper rolls by the drum, the toner is transferred to the paper printing the letters or other
graphics on the paper. A hot roller bonds the toner to the paper,

Laser printers use buffers that store an entire page at a time. When a whole page is loaded, it will
be printed. The speed of laser printers is high and it prints quietly without producing much noise.
Many home-use laser printers can print eight pages per minute, but faster and print approximately
21,000 lines per minute, or 437 pages per minute (if each page contains 48 lines). When high
speed laser printers were introduced they were expensive. Developments in the last few years
have provided relatively low-cost laser printers for use in small businesses.

7.6 AWARD CERTIFICATES:

An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization in
recognition of their excellence in a certain field. An award may be accompanied by

the time to acknowledge them. And being the person who motivates others can be
rewarding, too.

Behaviour or Course Completion. MS Publisher provides many templates for creating
